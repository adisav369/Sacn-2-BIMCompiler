# SPEC — Resurrect `feat/landing-multimerge-viewer-saveopen` onto current main

```
# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE
SCOPE: reconcile a REAL, stale, unmerged bim-ootb branch onto current main — NOT new-feature work. Read the log
after every run. Full origin story / why this branch matters: prompts/GRID_PREDRAG_PREVIEW_SAVE_COMPLETEIT.md
§B "Versioning". This spec is Watchdog-tracked (see closing note) — every DONE claim needs a § log line.
```

## WHY (don't re-derive — confirmed 2026-07-05)
`origin/feat/landing-multimerge-viewer-saveopen`, last touched **2026-06-19** (1 substantive commit `525eb18`,
253 commits behind current `main` but only 6 files touched), contains real, tested work that was never landed —
apparently dropped amid a later landing-page redesign, not deliberately rejected (its own code already follows
today's no-card convention — see the constraint below). It contains:
1. `import_own.js` `importMultiIFC()` — drop 2+ IFC files → merges into ONE building record (concatenated
   elements/geometries/transforms) → auto-opens the Viewer.
2. Real **"Save Building"/"Open Building" pills** (`Ctrl+S`/`Ctrl+O`) in `viewer/panels.js`/`pill_builder.js`,
   wired to `A.saveModelDb()`/`A.openModelDb()` — native OS Save-As/Open dialog for a real `.db` file.
3. `viewer/tests/witness_save_fold.js` (W-SAVE-FOLD) — proves `A._exportBuildingDb` folds a SPLIT (meta+geo)
   building into ONE monolith `.db`, zero geometry loss on round-trip.
4. A `versions[]` array + `latestVersion` index already in the landing page's per-project record shape.
5. `index2.html` (4-line diff) + `viewer/scene.js` (110-line diff, NOT yet reviewed in this recon — read it
   before reconciling, don't assume it's benign).

## ⚠ HARD CONSTRAINT — do not reintroduce a card/list UI
User confirmed 2026-07-05: an earlier landing-page "card" pattern (browsable list of past-imported buildings)
was deliberately dropped for a **security-perception concern** — showing a list of the user's own prior imports
felt like exposing private data. Current/correct UX: auto-launch straight into the Viewer, let the user Save
via the native OS dialog. This branch's own `importMultiIFC()` comment already says *"NO merge modal, NO
card"* — it already complies. **Do not let any card/list surface reappear while reconciling.** If `viewer/scene.js`'s
110-line diff or anything else in the branch shows card/list UI, strip it before landing — flag it as a finding,
don't silently keep it because "it was already there."

## STEPS
1. Read `viewer/scene.js`'s diff in full (110 lines, unreviewed) before touching anything — confirm no card/list
   surface, confirm it doesn't fight anything already shipped on main in the 253 commits since fork.
2. Work in a fresh `/tmp/wt-*` worktree off `origin/main` (never the shared `~/bim-ootb` checkout — hook-blocked).
   `git fetch && git checkout -b lane/landing-multimerge-resurrect origin/main`, then cherry-pick or manually
   port `525eb18`'s diff (do NOT merge the whole stale branch — its history is 253 commits removed from main;
   port the one substantive commit's changes onto fresh main instead).
3. Re-run `viewer/tests/witness_save_fold.js` against current main's actual DB schema — 253 commits of drift
   could have changed geometry/transform table shapes since this test was written. Fix if it fails; that's a
   real regression check, not a formality.
4. Confirm the fate of the `redpill`/"Doc Mode" pill: this commit's diff REPLACES it wholesale with Save/Open
   in the `_actions`/`_defaultOrder` arrays. Check whether Doc Mode independently evolved on main since
   2026-06-19 — if so, reconcile (don't blindly delete something that grew new dependents), don't just take the
   branch's version verbatim.
5. Confirm the `pill_builder.js` "outside-tap-to-close removed, only ⋯ press closes" decision (this commit's
   own comment: *"User decree: outside-tap-to-close was too easy to trigger by accident"*) still matches
   current pill UX — check for a conflicting decision made independently on main in the interim.
6. Live-verify (headless or real browser): drop 2+ IFC files on the landing hub → merges → Viewer opens with
   the combined building; `Ctrl+S` opens a real Save-As dialog; `Ctrl+O` opens a real file picker and correctly
   replaces the scene. Log every assertion with a `§` tag — this is exactly the class of claim the Watchdog
   Protocol requires evidence for.
7. PR to main. No card. No modal. No list. Just auto-launch + native Save/Open, as today's UX already commits to.

## DONE WHEN
1. `525eb18`'s content is live on current `main` (fresh commit, not a stale-history merge).
2. `witness_save_fold.js` green against current main.
3. Multimerge + Save + Open all live-verified with `§`-tagged evidence, zero card/list UI anywhere.
4. Doc Mode pill's fate is a deliberate reconciled decision, not an accidental silent overwrite either way.

## WATCHDOG NOTE (for whichever session closes this)
This item is tracked from `prompts/FRONTEND_LANE_MASTER.md §NEW BACKLOG`. Per the project's Watchdog Protocol:
the closing session's `# DONE` appendix needs a `§` log line for EVERY claim above — "verified live" without a
`§` line is not done, it's an assertion. Flag anything unproven rather than accepting it on trust.

## §SCENE_MERGE — "Open → merge into the current scene" (SPEC, 2026-07-29, NOT started)

**User's ask, their framing:** *"when we open a fresh IFC/DB in File Open it asks if we wish to merge
into the same scene/canvas"* — and the merge/variant options should live in the Open door itself,
including Open-source-IFC.

**Hard constraint from the user, same session: NO INVENTION.** Every part below already exists and
works today; this spec is wiring, not new machinery. Each claim carries its file:line — verify, don't
re-derive.

### §SM-1 What exists today (recon done — do NOT redo)
| piece | where | status |
|---|---|---|
| N buildings in ONE canvas, each with its OWN db | `city.js:11` `A.cityBuildingDbs = {}`; `:701` `= { db, libDb }` | **works — City mode uses it** |
| swap the active DB then draw | `city.js:707-708` (also `:796-797`, `:950`) `A.db = …[k].db; A.libDb = …[k].libDb` → `A.streamBuilding(name)` | **works** |
| track what's already drawn | `A.buildingCentres`, `A.buildingsRendered`, `A.savedStreams` (`streaming.js:39-60`) | **works** |
| dedup on merge | `import_db_builder.js:45` `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO elements_meta` — same GUID dropped twice collapses (proved live: CONTAINMENT dropped twice → 21,009 not 42,018) | **works** |
| merge-or-new PROMPT, already written | `archive/gallery.html:1045` `showMergeModal()` — "Merge X into Y?" / Merge / New, dropdown when >1 target, Enter=merge Esc=new; called at `:1369` | **works, just orphaned in archive/** |
| shared frame | `project_metadata.georef_offset_x/y/z`; multi-file drops already pin one frame from the first file — `import.js:308` `§GEOREF_SESSION frame pinned by …` | **works** |

> **⚠ CITATIONS RE-VERIFIED 2026-07-30 against `origin/main` — the original spec's were stale.**
> There is **no `viewer/import_own.js`** in this repo; the file is **`viewer/import.js`**
> (`importMultiIFC` at `:267`, `_parseOneIFC` at `:388`). Corrected throughout this section. Every
> `city.js` and `import_db_builder.js` line above was checked and is correct as written.

### §SM-2 The ONLY blocker
`scene.js:758`, inside `A._openDbBytes` (declared `scene.js:747`) — **line numbers verified against
`origin/main` 2026-07-30; they drift every week, so GREP THE SYMBOL, never trust the number**:
```js
location.assign('viewer.html?db=' + encodeURIComponent(dbUrl) + '&lib=' + … + '&ghost=1');
```
File Open **navigates the page**. The scene is destroyed and rebuilt. That is the whole reason
opening a second file resets the canvas — not a data limit, not a memory limit.

### §SM-3 What to build (wiring only)
1. In `A._openDbBytes` (`scene.js:747`): when a building is **already open**, show the prompt instead
   of navigating. Reuse `showMergeModal()` from `archive/gallery.html:1045` — port it, don't rewrite it.
   Note there are **two** call sites to cover — `scene.js:770` (FSA `showOpenFilePicker`) and `:779`
   (hidden `<input type=file>` fallback). ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-07-30 by the implementing session: 770 is
   NOT drag-drop — there is no drag-drop caller of `_openDbBytes`. Both sites live inside
   `A.openModelDb` (`scene.js:761`).**
2. **Replace** → today's `location.assign` path, unchanged.
3. **Merge** → do exactly what City mode does:
   - register the new DB: `A.cityBuildingDbs[newName] = { db, libDb }` (or the same shape under a
     non-city key — naming is the only new decision here)
   - `A.db = …; A.libDb = …;` then `A.streamBuilding(newName)`
   - the new building appears **alongside** the current one; `buildingsRendered` keeps both
4. **Frame:** the ALREADY-OPEN building's `project_metadata.georef_offset_*` is the pin. The incoming
   DB rebases to it — the same rule `import.js:299-310` already applies to a multi-file drop
   (`sessionGeorefOffset`, pinned by the first file that reports a non-zero offset), applied to an
   existing scene instead of the first file of a batch.
5. **Open source IFC in the same door:** the picker currently accepts `.db,.sqlite` only
   (`scene.js:774` `input.accept = '.db,.sqlite'`). Widen to `.ifc`, route to the existing
   `A.importMultiIFC` (`import.js:267`), then feed the produced DB into step 3. No new import path.

### §SM-4 Witness (name the issue, per project rule)
**W-SCENE-MERGE** — open building A, then Open→Merge building B:
- `§CENTRES` / `A.buildingCentres` has **2** keys, not 1
- `guidMap` total = A + B minus shared GUIDs (dedup is `INSERT OR IGNORE`, already proven)
- **no page navigation** — same `§HIST_SESSION` id before and after (today's reload mints a new one)
- both buildings' element counts non-zero in one `§CONTRACT_CHECK`

### §SM-5 Named risks (flagged, not solved)
- **Memory.** Two 485MB DBs resident = ~1GB of sql.js heap in one tab. City mode's DBs are much
  smaller. Needs a real measurement before promising N-way merge, not an assumption.
- **Variants vs federation are different things.** ⚠ **`§VERSION_MERGE` no longer exists** — grepped
  2026-07-30 across `viewer/`, `common/`, `archive/`: zero hits for `VERSION_MERGE` or
  `_rec.versions.push`. It lived in the gallery/landing code that is now in `archive/`. The *warning*
  still stands as doctrine — do not build scene-merge on a versioning path that OVERWRITES
  (`_rec.metaDb = …`) instead of accumulating — but **do not go looking for that code, it is gone.**
  A variant SWITCHER (show v1 or v2) remains a third, separate feature; don't fold it in without a
  decision.
- **The 4 GB wasm ceiling caps "Open source IFC" (step 5), and it is measured, not theoretical.**
  See `IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md` §KUL009: a 2,045 MB IFC consumes ~3.4 GB of the wasm32
  4 GB budget on *parse alone*, and geometry building dies at element #3,956 of 66,214. Each file
  does get a fresh Worker (`import.js:391` `new Worker(...)` + `terminate()` on done), so merging N
  files does not compound wasm memory — but any single source file near ~1 GB will silently import
  partial. Step 5 should surface that, not hide it behind a merge prompt.
- **Cross-check §KUL008_CACHE** in `prompts/IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md` before testing any
  edit to a precached `viewer/*.js` — bump `sw.js CACHE_VERSION` + the file's `?v=`, reload twice,
  or the change is invisible and looks like a code failure.

## §SM-6 SESSION BRIEF — build §SCENE_MERGE (added 2026-07-30, ready to assign)
```
# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE
SCOPE: implement §SM-3 only — a merge-or-replace prompt on File Open, so a second IFC/DB joins the
CURRENT canvas instead of navigating the page away. Wiring, not new machinery. Read the log after
every run. Every DONE claim needs a § log line. Do NOT touch §SM-1..§SM-5 conclusions — they are
verified. Do NOT widen into version/variant switching (§SM-5).
```

**All file:line below re-verified against `origin/main` on 2026-07-30. Trust them; don't re-derive.**

### The driving use case (real, from the user, not hypothetical)
KUL070 is delivered as multiple IFCs and **the ARCH/building-envelope package arrives later, separately.**
Today the user must re-drop every file together to see them as one building; opening the ARCH addition
into the loaded MEP model **replaces** it. That is the whole point of this work.

Concrete proof of why it matters, measured 2026-07-30 on `KUL070-...-OVERALL_complete.db`:
`doors=0  stairs=0  IfcSpace=0  walls=8  slabs=1` → `buildTour()` returns 0 actions → **Fly Tour (L)
never starts and the timeline scrubber never appears** (`tour.js:364` `A._scrubShow()` is only reached
from `_startFlyTour`). `ensureRooms` cannot rescue it — `navigate_find.js:1080` compiles rooms from
walls/doors and "refuses honestly (roomsWritten=0) if the building lacks them — never invents rooms."
**Merging the ARCH package in is what makes Fly/rooms/scrubber work on this building at all.**

### What already works — do not rebuild it
| capability | where | status |
|---|---|---|
| N IFCs → ONE building DB | `import.js:267` `A.importMultiIFC` | works, but only within a SINGLE drop |
| fresh Worker per file, terminated after | `import.js:391` + `worker.terminate()` | works — merging N files does NOT compound wasm memory |
| one shared frame across the drop | `import.js:299-310` `sessionGeorefOffset` → `§GEOREF_SESSION` | works |
| GUID dedup on insert | `import_db_builder.js:45` `INSERT OR IGNORE INTO elements_meta` | works |
| `building` + `project_metadata` written | `import_db_builder.js:28,38,48` (browser) and, as of 2026-07-30, `extractIFCtoDB.py` (CLI) | works both paths |
| N DBs in ONE canvas | `city.js:11` `A.cityBuildingDbs`, `:701`, `:707-708` → `A.streamBuilding()` | works — City mode uses it |
| the merge modal itself | `archive/gallery.html:1045` `showMergeModal()`, called `:1369` | written, orphaned in `archive/` — PORT it |

### The blocker, exactly
`scene.js:747` `A._openDbBytes` → `scene.js:758`
`location.assign('viewer.html?db=' + … + '&ghost=1')` — a full page navigation. Two call sites feed it:
`scene.js:770` (FSA picker) and `scene.js:779` (`<input type=file>` fallback) — **both inside
`A.openModelDb` (`:761`); there is NO drag-drop caller, contrary to an earlier claim here.**

> ⚠ **GREP THE SYMBOL, NOT THE LINE.** Every number in this file was re-verified against `origin/main`
> on 2026-07-30 — and two earlier passes had them wrong precisely because they were read from a stale
> local checkout (`~/bim-ootb` was 113 commits behind, and a `/tmp/wt-*` worktree 61 behind). `main`
> moves daily. Always `git show origin/main:viewer/scene.js | grep -n '_openDbBytes'` first.

### Build order
1. In `A._openDbBytes`, when a building is already loaded, show the ported `showMergeModal()` instead
   of navigating. Cover BOTH call sites (735 and 744).
2. **Replace** → today's `location.assign` path, byte-for-byte unchanged.
3. **Merge** → do what City mode does: `A.cityBuildingDbs[newName] = { db, libDb }`, then
   `A.db = …; A.libDb = …;` then `A.streamBuilding(newName)`. Naming the non-city key is the only
   genuinely new decision.
4. Frame: the ALREADY-OPEN building's `project_metadata.georef_offset_*` is the pin; the incoming DB
   rebases to it — the same rule `import.js:299-310` applies within a drop, applied to a live scene.
5. Widen `scene.js:774` `input.accept` to include `.ifc` and route to `A.importMultiIFC`, then feed the
   produced DB into step 3. No new import path.

### Witness — W-SCENE-MERGE (name the issue, per project rule)
Open A, then Open→Merge B:
- `A.buildingCentres` has **2** keys, not 1
- element total = A + B minus shared GUIDs (`INSERT OR IGNORE`, already proven)
- **no page navigation** — same `§HIST_SESSION` id before and after (today's reload mints a new one)
- both buildings non-zero in one `§CONTRACT_CHECK`
- **the real one for this use case:** merge the ARCH package into KUL070-OVERALL and assert
  `doors>0 AND IfcSpace>0` in the merged scene, then that `buildTour()` returns ≥1 action and
  `§SCRUB_PREPARE` appears on L. That is the user-visible payoff; a centres count alone doesn't prove it.

### Landmines specific to this task — all measured, none speculative
- **`import://` cannot be fetched.** An opened local file gets a `import://<name>/v0` DB_URL, so any
  code deriving a URL from it fails: witnessed `Fetch API cannot load import://…/patches/v0.sql —
  URL scheme "import" is not supported` → `§PATCH_APPLY_FAIL`. Harmless for the patch (opened files
  have no curated patch) but **do not build the merge on any DB_URL-derived fetch.**
- **Memory is the real ceiling, and it is per-DB not per-wasm.** KUL070's DB alone is 311 MB resident
  in sql.js. Two of these in one tab is ~620 MB before geometry. City-mode DBs are far smaller.
  **Measure before promising N-way merge** — and note `§QUOTA available=11816MB used=1576MB` is
  IndexedDB, not heap.
- **Every edit re-exports the WHOLE DB.** `kernel_ops.js:125` debounces 2 s then
  `db.export()` → IDB put. At 311 MB per building that is already heavy; a merged 620 MB scene makes
  it heavier. Not a blocker for this task, but do not add a per-merge persist on top of it.
- **`§VERSION_MERGE` no longer exists** (grepped 2026-07-30: zero hits in `viewer/`, `common/`,
  `archive/`). Its doctrine still stands — do not build on a path that OVERWRITES `_rec.metaDb`
  instead of accumulating — but the code is gone, don't hunt for it.
- **Precache: bump `sw.js CACHE_VERSION` + the file's own `?v=`, then reload TWICE**, or the edit is
  invisible and looks like a code failure. Currently `v884`. See
  `IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md §KUL008_CACHE`.
- **Envelope-dependent UI will change behaviour once ARCH merges in.** KUL070's envelope is 9 of
  87,333 (0.01%), so `§BBOX_GHOST_ALL` currently fires for Alt+Z. After an ARCH merge it won't — that
  is correct, not a regression. Don't "fix" it.

## §SM-7 IMPLEMENTATION SPEC — §SCENE_MERGE (written 2026-07-30, BEFORE any code; Spec-First)

Branch `lane/scene-merge` off `origin/main@41510da`, worktree `/tmp/wt-scene-merge`.

### §SM-7.0 Recon corrections found while implementing (spec was slightly wrong)
1. **`scene.js:770` is NOT drag-drop.** Both call sites of `A._openDbBytes` live inside
   `A.openModelDb` — `:770` is the Chromium **FSA** `showOpenFilePicker` branch and `:779` is the
   `<input type=file>` **fallback** branch. There is no third caller (`grep -n '_openDbBytes'
   viewer/*.js` → 3 hits total, all in `scene.js`). Covering `_openDbBytes` itself covers both, so
   the prompt/modal goes **inside `_openDbBytes`**, not at the two call sites.
2. **`Clinic_extracted.db` is not one building — it is FIVE.** `elements_meta.building` holds
   `Clinic_Architectural_IFC2x3 / _Electrical_ / _HVAC_ / _Plumbing_ / _Structural_` (2586 / 2118 /
   3704 / 6585 / 1078 = 16,114 elements). So the witness's literal "`buildingCentres` has 2 keys"
   cannot hold for Clinic: merging Clinic into Duplex gives **1 → 6**. Same proof, different number.
   It is also the *exact* KUL070 shape (per-discipline packages arriving as separate names).
3. **Column sets differ between real DBs.** `Duplex.component_geometries` has a `normals` column;
   `Clinic.component_geometries` does **not**. A naive `INSERT INTO … SELECT *` therefore throws.
   The merge must intersect the destination's column list with the source's.
   Related: `A._libHasNormals` is probed **once** and cached (`streaming.js:868`) — the merge must
   never invalidate it, which the intersect rule guarantees (dest schema never changes).
4. **`A.modelOffset` must NOT be recomputed on merge.** Building A's meshes were already placed
   using the current `modelOffset`; changing it would silently shift everything already drawn.
   Building B rebases into A's existing frame instead. (This is why step 4 below is a *DB-side*
   rebase, not a viewer-side offset change.)
5. **City mode is not a drop-in template.** City mode swaps `A.db` because its `A.db` is the *city
   index* — one metadata DB already holding every building; only geometry is per-archetype. The
   faithful analogue for a single-scene merge is therefore: fold B's **metadata into the live
   `A.db`** (and its geometry into `A.libDb`), keep B's own `building` names, and leave `A.db`
   pointing at the one DB. Swapping `A.db` to B's DB would make A un-queryable → `§CONTRACT_CHECK`,
   panels, rooms and tour would all lose building A.

### §SM-7.1 Design (wiring only — every mechanism named already exists)
- `A._showMergeModal(fileName, targetName)` — **port** of `archive/gallery.html:1045`
  `showMergeModal()`: same two-button shape, Enter = merge, Esc = new, same "Merge X into Y?" copy.
  Ported changes, all forced by the host page: (a) `viewer.html` has none of gallery's five modal
  elements, so the DOM is built once on first use and reused (`#merge-modal`, `#merge-target`,
  `#merge-btn`, `#merge-new-btn`); (b) the `>1 target` `<select>` branch is dropped — a Viewer scene
  has exactly one active building, so there is never a list. **No card, no list surface** (HARD
  CONSTRAINT above holds).
- `A._mergeDbIntoScene(fileName, bytes)` — the merge itself:
  1. `new (A._SQL).Database(bytes)` — `A._SQL` is the cached sql.js factory (`streaming.js:1836`).
  2. **Frame rebase** — read `project_metadata.georef_offset_{x,y,z}` from both. If BOTH sides
     report a value and they differ, `UPDATE element_transforms SET center_x = center_x + (inc-pin)`
     on the *incoming* DB. This is `import.js:299-310`'s `sessionGeorefOffset` rule (first frame
     pins, later files rebase) applied to a live scene. Log `§MERGE_GEOREF`. Neither Clinic nor
     Duplex carries these keys → `mode=none` for the witness, which is correct, not a skip.
  3. **Fold tables**, `INSERT OR IGNORE`, destination-column-intersected:
     `elements_meta`, `element_transforms`, `element_instances` → `A.db`;
     `component_geometries` (+`base_geometries` if present) → `A.libDb`;
     plus `rel_contained_in_space`, `spatial_structure`, `tasks`, `task_elements`,
     `task_sequences`, `schedules`, `bom_tree` when the table exists on BOTH sides (these are what
     rooms / 4D read). `INSERT OR IGNORE` is the already-proven dedup (`import_db_builder.js:45`).
  4. `src.close()` — free the source DB immediately (§SM-5 memory).
  5. Register in the City shape for API symmetry: `A.cityBuildingDbs[name] = {db: A.db, libDb: A.libDb}`.
  6. Add ONLY the new building names to `A.buildingCentres` (re-running the `GROUP BY m.building`
     query from `streaming.js:2119`), carry `envelope` over from an existing centre, refresh
     `A.totalElements` / `A.discCounts` / `updateHUD()` / `populateBuildingList()`.
  7. Stream the new names **sequentially** via `A._mergePending` + `A._mergeStreamNext()`, drained
     from the existing stream-complete hook (`streaming.js:721`, where City already drains
     `_cityStreamNext`). One added line, mirroring the line above it.
- `A._openDbBytes` gains a single guard at the top: a building already open → prompt; `merge` →
  `_mergeDbIntoScene` and **return** (no navigation); `new`/Esc → falls through to today's
  `location.assign` path, byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Picker widened: `input.accept` `.db,.sqlite` → `.db,.sqlite,.ifc`, FSA `types` likewise; a `.ifc`
  pick routes to the existing `A.importMultiIFC` (`import.js:267`) and feeds its produced DB into the
  same merge. `importMultiIFC` gains a `return {key, record, buildingName, ...}` at its success tail
  (additive — every existing caller ignores the return value).

### §SM-7.2 Witness — W-SCENE-MERGE (`viewer/tests/witness_scene_merge_2026-07-30.js`)
Names the issue: *does File Open still destroy the scene?* Real browser, real DBs, real Open pill
path (`filechooser` → hidden input → `_openDbBytes` → modal → `#merge-btn` click). Asserts, all from
`§` log lines plus live object state read out of the running page:
| # | claim | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | scene not navigated away | `§HIST_SESSION id=` identical before/after; `performance.navigation`-independent `window.__sceneMergeEpoch` marker planted pre-Open survives |
| 2 | centres grew | `§MERGE_CENTRES before=1 after=6 added=…` + `Object.keys(A.buildingCentres)` read live |
| 3 | dedup arithmetic | `§MERGE_ROWS elements_meta src=… ins=… dup=…`, and `ins = src − (GUIDs already present)` recomputed in-page from the merged DB |
| 4 | both buildings rendered | `§MERGE_CONTRACT` per-building count of `A.guidMap` GUIDs joined back to `elements_meta.building` — both sides > 0 — emitted next to `§CONTRACT_CHECK` |
| 5 | replace path intact | Esc on the modal still reaches `§OPEN_DB … → navigate` |

### §SM-7.3 Deploy-visibility (mandatory, else the edit is invisible)
`viewer/sw.js CACHE_VERSION v884 → v885`; `viewer.html` `scene.js?v=54→55`, `streaming.js?v=58→59`,
`import.js?v=3→4`. Per §KUL008_CACHE, reload twice.

## §SM-8 DONE — §SCENE_MERGE shipped 2026-07-30, bim-ootb PR #1093 (squash-merged to `main`)

Branch `lane/scene-merge` off `origin/main@41510da`. Files: `viewer/scene.js` (+~250),
`viewer/streaming.js` (+23), `viewer/import.js` (+4), `viewer/sw.js`, `viewer/viewer.html`,
plus two new witnesses. **§SM-3 is CLOSED. §SM-5 (variants/versioning) untouched, as scoped.**

### What landed (matches §SM-7.1 exactly; nothing improvised)
`A._showMergeModal` (port of `archive/gallery.html:1045`, no card/list/dropdown) ·
`A._mergeDbIntoScene` (metadata → live `A.db`, geometry → `A.libDb`, `INSERT OR IGNORE`,
incoming `building` names preserved) · `A._mergeStreamNext` (sequential drain chained off the
EXISTING stream-complete hook beside City's `_cityStreamNext`) · georef pin/rebase from
`import.js:299-310`'s rule · Esc/New = today's `location.assign` byte-for-byte · Open door widened to
`.ifc` → existing `A.importMultiIFC` (which now RETURNS its produced DB) → same merge.
`sw.js` v884→**v885**, `scene.js?v=55`, `streaming.js?v=59`, `import.js?v=4`.

### W-SCENE-MERGE — `viewer/tests/witness_scene_merge_2026-07-30.js`, 24/24 🟢 exit 0
Duplex (A) → Open→Merge Clinic (B), driven through the real Open-pill path
(`filechooser` → hidden input → `_openDbBytes` → modal → `#merge-btn`).

| §SM-4 claim | proving § line |
|---|---|
| centres > 1 | `§MERGE_CENTRES before=1 after=6 added=[5 Clinic discipline buildings]` |
| total = A + B − shared GUIDs | `§MERGE_ROWS table=elements_meta src=16114 before=1122 after=17236 added=16114 dup=0 errs=0` (0 overlap + the 4 shared geometry hashes both pre-verified offline via `ATTACH`) |
| geometry folded | `§MERGE_ROWS table=component_geometries src=8461 before=814 after=9271 added=8457 dup=4 errs=0` |
| **no page navigation** | in-page epoch marker + document URL both survive; `§HIST_SESSION` fires exactly ONCE (post-merge lines=0) and the live `sessionStorage` id is still `s…` from first load; **and PHASE 3's Esc/replace DOES wipe that marker** → the detector is real, not a no-op |
| both buildings non-zero | `§MERGE_CONTRACT rendered={Duplex:1119, Clinic_ARC:2586, _ELE:2118, _HVAC:3704, _PLU:6585, _STR:1078}` alongside `§CONTRACT_CHECK guidMap=17190 streamed=17190 orphans=0`, zero `§CONTRACT_FAIL` |
| dedup is real | re-merging the SAME DB: `added=0 dup=16114`, totals + centres unchanged |
| schema mismatch survived | 5-col source into 4-col dest: `inserted=4 src=5 dst=4 errs=0` |
| replace path intact | `§MERGE_CHOICE action=new` → `§OPEN_DB … → navigate` → browser lands on the `import://` URL |

### W-SCENE-MERGE-IFC — `viewer/tests/witness_scene_merge_ifc_2026-07-30.js`, 12/12 🟢 exit 0
`SampleHouse_ARC.ifc` (2.3MB) into a live Duplex scene: `accept=".db,.sqlite,.ifc"` read off the LIVE
`<input>` · `§MULTI_IMPORT_DONE building=SampleHouse_ARC elements=60` · `§OPEN_IFC_DB bytes=1773568` ·
`§MERGE_CENTRES before=1 after=2` (the literal "2 keys, not 1" of §SM-4) ·
`§MERGE_CONTRACT rendered={Duplex:1119, SampleHouse_ARC:58}` · no navigation.
No screenshots anywhere — every claim is a `§` value or a number read out of the running page.

### NEW landmines found by doing it (add to §SM-6's list)
1. **sql.js `exec` returns ONLY statements that produced rows.** `SELECT * … LIMIT 0` yields `[]`, not
   a column list. The first cut used it for column discovery → the merge silently did **nothing**
   (`§MERGE_DONE newBuildings=0` with zero `§MERGE_ROWS` lines, and every other assertion still
   green). Fixed with `PRAGMA table_info` + a hard `§MERGE_FAIL` when `elements_meta` fails to fold,
   so a silent no-op cannot recur.
2. **Real DBs disagree on columns.** `Duplex.component_geometries` has `normals`, `Clinic`'s does not
   → insert on the destination∩source intersection, driven by the destination so its schema never
   changes (which is what keeps the once-probed, cached `A._libHasNormals` honest post-merge).
3. **`§SM-6`'s "`scene.js:770` = drag-drop" is wrong.** Both `_openDbBytes` call sites are inside
   `A.openModelDb` — the FSA branch and the `<input type=file>` fallback. There is no drag-drop caller.
   Guarding `_openDbBytes` itself covers both.
4. **`Clinic_extracted.db` is FIVE buildings, not one** (`Clinic_{Architectural,Electrical,HVAC,
   Plumbing,Structural}_IFC2x3`), so §SM-4's literal "2 keys" reads 1→6 with this fixture. It is also
   the exact KUL070 shape, which is why the sequential N-building drain (§SM-7.1 step 7) was needed
   at all — `streamBuilding()` handles ONE name.
5. **`A.modelOffset` must never be recomputed on merge** — A's meshes are already placed against it.
   The rebase is DB-side (`UPDATE element_transforms`), never a viewer-side offset change.
6. **DB-snapshot divergence bit this work directly** (cf. `project_db_snapshot_divergence_landmine`):
   `?db=buildings/Duplex_extracted.db` resolves to **`viewer/buildings/`**, which in `~/bim-ootb` is a
   symlink farm into `bim-compiler/deploy/buildings/` — a 9.2MB / 1122-element / no-`normals` Duplex,
   NOT the 14.9MB / 1119-element / has-`normals` `~/bim-ootb/buildings/` copy. The witness harness now
   logs the resolved realpath+size of every `.db` it serves. Related self-inflicted trap: running
   `sqlite3 <path>` on a non-existent path **creates a 0-byte DB**, which then shadowed the real
   fixture and made the whole viewer load fail (`§CENTRES_QUERY tables=[]`). Never probe a fixture
   path with `sqlite3` inside a served tree.

### Still open / deliberately NOT done
- **§SM-4's KUL070 payoff assertion is UNPROVEN** — merging the ARCH package into `KUL070-OVERALL`
  and asserting `doors>0 AND IfcSpace>0` → `buildTour()` ≥1 action → `§SCRUB_PREPARE` on L was not
  run: the ARCH package is not on this machine (`KUL070-…-OVERALL_complete.db` has `0 doors /
  0 IfcSpace` and there is no separate ARCH DB/IFC to merge into it). The mechanism it depends on is
  proven above on Clinic+Duplex; the KUL070-specific payoff needs the ARCH file. **⛔ ONE QUESTION:
  where is the KUL070 ARCH/envelope package?**
- **§SM-5 memory is still unmeasured** for two 300MB-class DBs in one tab. Nothing here promises
  N-way merge at that size; the merge streams rows one at a time and closes the source DB immediately
  rather than materialising a second full table in JS, which is the cheap half of the problem only.
- Version/variant switching (§SM-5) untouched, as scoped.
