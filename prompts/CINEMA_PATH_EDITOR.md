# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE
**Scope:** ONE feature — a waypoint editor that opens after the Alt+C preview, lists the cinema path's
waypoints with their camera info, and lets the user key or drag them before the bake. The "simplest
fastest tour maker."
**Not in scope:** the §CINEMA_SPACE attic-pick default — **owned by another session as of 2026-07-26,
do not touch `_cinemaPathPlan`'s §CINEMA_SPACE block (~L3486-3610)**; see §Out of scope below.
**Read the log after every run.** Verification on this project is `§`-tagged console output, not
screenshots — and for anything continuous (camera path, angles, Z) it is the NUMBERS, per CLAUDE.md's
FUNDAMENTAL LAW. Honour this block until this file is DONE.
**⚠ READING ORDER for a fresh session:** §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR_MODEL (settled data model) → §CPE_BUILT
(what shipped) → §CPE_LIVE (browser run + the defect it caught) → **§CPE_BANDS (next build, spec ready,
NOT implemented)** → **§CPE_PACING (measured, ONE user decision open)**. The "graph dialog" framing in
the original sections is SUPERSEDED throughout.

**STATUS 2026-07-27 (session end):** everything specced in this file is BUILT AND WITNESSED.
- §CPE_BANDS + full-film tube → **merged to main, PR #1026**.
- §CPE_SCREEN_PLANE + §CPE_PACING → **PR #1027, auto-merge armed, e2e was still running at session
  end. FIRST THING NEXT SESSION: confirm #1027 landed** (`gh pr view 1027 --json state`); if CI went
  red, that is the only loose end.
- The pacing decision is ANSWERED — user: *"I already said derived"* — dive, spin and orbit are all
  derived. Built. **One thing is left to LOOK AT, not decide: the derived totals do not match the
  ~15s/~40s expectation** — see §CPE_PACING_BUILT.

**REVIEWING this work?** Go straight to **§CPE_REVIEW_PACK** — mechanism-by-mechanism explanation,
every measured number with the log line that produced it, and the 7 known issues I did NOT fix.
It opens by naming the highest-risk thing to check first (I changed two failing gates and they
went green — verify I corrected the instruments rather than lowered the bar).

**RESUME AT:** **§CPE_JERK_SETTLED** (the LATER 2026-07-27 session-end block, near the end of this
file). Jerk and drag are both SOLVED and witnessed there; the elegant formula that solved them is
recorded as settled doctrine and must not be re-derived.

**▶ FORWARD QUEUE (agreed with the user 2026-07-29): `prompts/CINEMA_DELIGHT_BATCH.md`** — six delight
items (hover-scrub, room titles, suggested clips + suggested detours, film audio, Find→Film, speed
ramps) with costs, traps and four open questions that must be answered before building. It also names
the cost that bites first: `§CPE_REPLAN_SLOW ms=600–1000` on EVERY edit on Terminal.

**NEXT DIRECTION (agreed 2026-07-28, spec-only, nothing built): §CPE_HOSE** at the END of this file —
whole-path editing by arc-length falloff (the band and the hose unified as one gesture), §CPE_CLIP
in/out markers, and the §CPE_BUILDUP construction checkbox (= §MAXQ_TIME mode D in
`PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md`). Read its §2 ARC-LENGTH LAW first — a world-distance falloff re-introduces
the out-and-back bug that removed §CPE_DRAG_REACH in #1038.

**⚠ 2026-07-27 (later, live user run on Hospital):** OK-after-an-edit CRASHED the bake on shipped
main — `§CPE_OK_CRASH`, root-caused, fixed and witnessed 6/6 (`witness_cpe_ok_bake.js`, the first
gate that walks editor → OK → bake instead of the plan seam). Read **§CPE_OK_CRASH** at the end of
this file before anything else on this lane.

**VISION CAPTURE (2026-07-28, interim — not a spec, commits to no new build order): §CPE_VISION_CHAIN**
at the END of this file — the user's own end-to-end sequencing for where this lane goes (space-awareness
→ auto-hose → edit → buildup POC → smart markers → real schedule data later), written down so it isn't
only in one person's head. Read for context; the "still open" list at its end is real work, not decided.

# §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR — the simplest fastest tour maker

## The one sentence
**Build §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR as the SIMPLEST FASTEST TOUR MAKER — no new icon, no new panel: Alt+C
already computes the plan in ~50–100 ms, so put a DIALOG in that existing gap showing the path as a
graph (reuse the Find panel's route visual) with the per-beat camera angle/Z, and the user either
hits OK to proceed straight into the recording exactly as today, or drags a waypoint / fixes the
camera Z that currently dives into the attic first — with an explicit **"Save this path"** action
that stores the edit as a `cinema_path` table in the building DB exactly the way
`staffage_instances` already round-trips.**

## Origin
User, 2026-07-26 evening, *after* the foundation below was laid and landed:
> "once a path is done, the user can cancel or not, a new feature when pressed calls up a graph panel
> of the scene path and cam angle... That way this time the user can adjust the path points, Z level
> of the camera as now it goes for the attic."

then, scoping it:
> "it is to be the simplest fastest tour maker — perhaps a dialog box with the graph (similar to Find
> rooms path visually as idea) and user can OK to proceed or adjust it, thus no need extra icon."

## §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR_MODEL — the settled interaction model (user, 2026-07-26, in discussion)
**This section is the spec. Where it disagrees with the "graph dialog" wording elsewhere in this
file, this wins.** Settled point by point with the user; nothing here is inferred.

### The data model — one authored thing, everything else derived
1. **Waypoints are the ONLY authored data.** A waypoint is a position plus a camera height. Nothing
   else is stored.
2. **Camera angle is NEVER authored.** It is LOS — the look direction at waypoint *n* is toward
   waypoint *n+1*. This is why the table carries **one extra final row** (the stopping waypoint): it
   exists to give the last real leg something to look at.
3. **Therefore "adjust the POV" is not a separate gesture.** Dragging waypoint *n+1* is *how* you
   change waypoint *n*'s camera angle. Falls out of (2) for free.
4. **Consequence, load-bearing:** no authored yaw/pitch anywhere → `cinema_path` stores positions and
   times only → **§CINEMA_TURN_SLERP keeps deriving headings from the path exactly as today.** Its
   witness (G6) stays green without being weakened to accommodate this feature. An earlier
   per-waypoint-authored-aim design was considered and dropped for precisely this reason.

### Geometry — no sharp corners can exist
5. **The waypoints are CONTROL points, not corners.** The flown path is smooth everywhere by
   construction, so "sharp corner" is not a state the path can reach. User's own words: *"that means
   there are no 'sharp' corners."*
6. **The curve CUTS INSIDE the corner** (user directive: *"yes cut inside"*) — it does not pass exactly
   through the placed point. The turn is eaten by geometry, not by slowing down.
7. **The cut is BOUNDED BY MEASURED CLEARANCE, not a constant.** `A.cinemaFan` (exposed
   `effects.js:4079`) is already this project's single source for real measured clearance-to-nearest-
   surface — §CINEMA_SPACE calls it "the ONLY where-is-open-space source". The rounding radius at each
   waypoint comes from it. Tight room → tight curve; open hall → wide graceful arc. **Do not invent a
   fixed fillet radius** — that would be exactly the kind of guessed constant the prime rule forbids.
8. **This retires an ungated defect.** "D2 walk-out corner whip — 19.8°/frame, printed by the witness,
   not gated" (listed under §Out of scope) is the user's reported *"about 2 jerks, fast jump at least a
   frame."* It was tolerable only because the derived route is tame. Once waypoints are user-draggable,
   sharp input becomes trivial to create — so smoothing moves IN SCOPE here and gets a real gate (G7).

### Timing — constant speed, editable total
9. **Constant speed. Path length sets the clock.** Drag a point further out and the total rises from
   24s. The displayed total is the truth about what was authored, not a fixed budget.
10. **The total is then itself an editable field.** Key 20s and the whole clip speeds up uniformly;
    key 40s and it slows. Uniform scale over the whole film, not per-leg.
11. **Cost that sits behind that field:** total × fps = frames to bake. 24s = 576 frames; 40s = 960,
    i.e. ~1.7× the render time. Surface it, don't hide it.

### Interaction — reuse, nothing invented
12. **The editor opens AFTER the 10s preview**, with the camera already returned to its initial pose
    (`cinema_maxq.js` already saves/restores it — `camSave`, ~L429).
13. **Click a row (or its waypoint) to HOLD it.** The scene camera backs up so that waypoint is framed.
    `A.controls.enabled = false` while held — the established pattern here, not a new one
    (`grid_drag.js:568/650`, `city.js:993/1013`, `doc_canvas.js:1450/1502`).
14. **Held-point verbs mirror the viewer's own navigation verbs** (user: *"isn't that intuitive?"*):
    - **drag** → move the waypoint on the horizontal plane through its own height (x, z)
    - **ctrl+drag** → move it vertically (camera height — the original complaint)
    - **wheel** → still scene zoom, NOT point depth. Releasing just to look closer would defeat the
      point of holding; x/z/height are already fully covered by the two drags.
15. **Double-click empty canvas to RELEASE** (user directive — single click was rejected as too easy to
    trigger and lose focus). Canvas `dblclick` is claimed only by measure mode (`picking.js:150`), so
    this collides with nothing. Touch has no `dblclick`: reuse the existing 350ms double-tap detector
    at `picking.js:174`, do not write a second one.
16. **While a point is held, single click does nothing** — it must not run element picking, or mid-edit
    clicks select the walls behind the waypoint.
17. **The held state must be unmistakable** — pulsing waypoint + highlighted row + a status line saying
    a point is held and double-click releases. A frozen-but-unexplained canvas reads as a hang.
18. **The pulse reuses §SELECT-PULSE** (`navigate_find.js:2160-2227`): generation counter + rAF +
    `markDirty`, and critically `depthTest:false`/`renderOrder` so the marker **shines through walls** —
    load-bearing, since the camera is outside the building when the editor opens.
19. **Two-way binding is required.** Key a number in the table → the canvas moves. Drag in the canvas →
    the number updates. Same state, two views.

### One defect this design exposes (fix as part of the work)
20. `cinema_maxq.js:357-360` claims `A._maxqActive`, `_wakeAcquire()` and `_dampHold()` **before** the
    plan/preview. `A._maxqActive` makes `dlod_nav.js:307` report `'cinema'` and fully disengage DLOD.
    An editor opening after the preview inherits all three — so a user editing for five minutes holds a
    screen wake-lock and runs Terminal/Hospital at full detail with no LOD the whole time. **The editor
    must release all three while open and re-claim them on OK.**

### Amendment on record — scope guardrail 3 is void
Guardrail 3 below says *"do NOT build an in-viewport 3D drag gizmo."* The user directed exactly that on
2026-07-26 (*"as we click on each row, appears a cam-eye 3d icon... user can adjust... and the canvas
reflects that changed path"*, then the freeze/drag/double-click model above). **Recorded as a deliberate
user amendment, not drift.** Guardrails 1, 2, 4 and 5 stand unchanged — in particular **guardrail 2: OK
without an edit must still be byte-identical to today.**

### Witness claims for this model (in addition to G1-G6 below)
- **G7** no-sharp-corners: on a path with a deliberately sharp authored corner, peak angular rate stays
  under a stated °/frame cap — the same measurement that today prints 19.8°/frame ungated. This is what
  makes "graceful" a NUMBER rather than a look.
- **G8** clearance-bounded rounding: the flown curve's maximum deviation from each authored waypoint is
  ≤ the `A.cinemaFan` clearance measured at that waypoint. Proves the cut-inside is bounded by measured
  space, never by a guessed constant.
- **G9** constant speed + uniform scale: doubling a leg's length raises the total proportionally at
  unchanged m/s; then setting the total to T re-times every leg by the same factor (sampled speeds
  ratio-identical).
- **G10** LOS: sampled look direction at each waypoint points at the next waypoint (within the smoothing
  tolerance), and moving waypoint *n+1* changes waypoint *n*'s aim — the (3) claim, measured.
- **G11** lock release: while the editor is open `A._maxqActive` is false and the wake-lock is released;
  both are re-claimed on OK. Proves defect (20) is actually fixed rather than described.

## §CPE_BUILT — implemented and witnessed 2026-07-27 (`bim-ootb` `feat/cinema-path-editor` @ `bc242be`)
**Status: the model above is BUILT. All gates green except where noted.** Files: new
`viewer/cinema_path_editor.js`; `viewer/effects.js` (corner rounding + override wrapper + persistence
read); `viewer/scene.js` (`cinema_path` write + `A.three2ifc`); `viewer/cinema_maxq.js` (hook + lock
release); `viewer/sw.js` v851→v852.

### Measured results — `witness_cinema_path_editor.js` 9/9 on Duplex AND Terminal
| gate | result |
|---|---|
| G1 OK-without-edit byte-identical | `maxPoseDiff=0` (exactly zero, both buildings) |
| G2 edit changes the path, not the dive before it | `maxDelta=4.30m firstDiffT=0.3375` vs `diveEnds=0.250` |
| G3 height moves by what was asked | straight path: `[1.5000,1.5000]`, err `0.00e+0` |
| G5 control, no authored path | `authored=false route=line`, replan diff `0.00e+0` |
| **G7 no sharp corners** | **7.5°/frame** on a 90° dog-leg, cap 12 — was 19.8 ungated |
| G8 deviation ≤ measured clearance | `dev=1.70m` vs `clear=7.31m/11.35m` (Duplex), `60.00m` (Terminal) |
| G9 constant speed | length ×1.371 → time ×1.371 exactly, at 2.10 m/s (Duplex) / 4.16 m/s (Terminal) |
| G10 LOS aim → next waypoint | `aimErr=0.7°` (Duplex), `5.8°` (Terminal) |
| G12 elastic orbit | endY −4.14→−0.14; clamp fires and is logged (`requested=31.9 granted=45.0 clamped=true`) |

`witness_cinema_path_persist.js` **7/7**: G4b writes no table without an explicit save; G4 round-trips
through a REAL page reload (`_openDbBytes` navigates) at `maxPoseDiff=0.0000m`; G11 proves
`_maxqActive=false` observed from INSIDE the open editor.

### Two real defects the witnesses caught — both were silent, neither was visible in review
1. **`settle` did not follow waypoint 0.** Beats 1-2 flew to the §CINEMA_SPACE pick while Beat 3
   started from `outWp[0]`, so editing row 0 teleported the camera at the beat seam. G3 measured it
   exactly: a 1.5m edit gave `[0.000, 1.508]` — the `0.000` IS the seam.
2. **`odx/odz` still pointed along the DERIVED exit.** Beat 3's gaze falls back to it in the last
   half-metre of the walk, and Beat 4 assumes it is the direction Beat 3 ends on. With an authored
   path the gaze SNAPPED onto the old bearing: **115.2°/frame**, six times worse than the whip this
   feature set out to retire. Both fixed by re-aiming them at the authored path.

### G3's second-order term, reported not hidden
On a path WITH corners the same 1.5m height edit lands at `[1.465, 1.508]`, spread 3.5cm. Not a height
error: raising the path makes the corner fans hit different geometry, so the rounding radius — and with
it the arc-length parameterization — legitimately shifts. Gated exactly on a straight path; printed as
`INFO` on a cornered one.

### ⚠ G6 finding — 5 of 6 pre-existing cinema witnesses are ALREADY RED on `origin/main`
Verified by running each on both the branch and unmodified `origin/main`, and diffing: **byte-identical
output in every case**, so this feature regresses nothing. But the baseline itself is not green:
- `witness_cinema_orbit_v2` — **PASS** (6/6) on the branch.
- `witness_cinema_damping_bleed` — **CRASHES** on both (180s `waitForFunction` timeout at its line 65).
  This is the §CINEMA_DAMPING_BLEED witness the scope header names as must-stay-green; it cannot
  currently prove anything either way.
- `witness_cinema_exit_breathe` — 5/7 on both. Fails its own G0 precondition (`oci 0/1` — one run
  fetched from object storage, so the two runs are not the same film) and G1.
- `witness_cinema_flat_ending`, `witness_cinema_reciprocal`, `witness_cinema_glazing` — FAIL identically
  on both.
**Not fixed here — out of this file's scope, and fixing a red baseline under a feature branch would
hide which change moved which number.** Named so it is a known state, not a surprise. Note
`witness_cinema_reciprocal` needs `HHS_Office_Federated_extracted.db` present or it reports a
misleading `PLAN FAILED` that looks like a code fault.

### §CPE_LIVE — first real-browser run, user, Hospital, 2026-07-27 (`b0db992`)
**The interaction model works end to end in a real browser**, proven by the user's own pasted console:
`§CPE_OPEN waypoints=3 pathLen=29.0m speed=4.83m/s` → `§CPE_HOLD i=0 controls.enabled=false` →
`§CPE_DRAG i=1 axis=xz` → `§CPE_RELEASE why=dblclick` → `§CPE_CLOSE action=ok edited=true total=32.6s`
→ `§CPE_APPLIED total=32.6s frames=489` → bake started. Constant-speed re-timing confirmed live:
pathLen 29.0→70.4m took the film 24.0→32.6s and the frame count 360→489.

**Why Hospital shows only 3 rows** (user asked): not a limit. `§ROOM_GRAPH … exits=0`, so `§CINEMA_EXIT`
fell back to `src=db-doors`, and the graph-route branch only runs for `EXIT::` nodes. The derived route
is therefore `settle → door → outside` — 3 points, 1 corner. A building whose room graph yields exits
gets the corridor waypoints too. User's verdict: *"3 points is also good, simple just adjust intended
edges."*

**⚠ The defect the live log exposed that every witness had missed.** `_cinemaFan` returns
`CINEMA_FAN_FAR` (60) for a ray that hits nothing, so a fan hitting nothing AT ALL reports `min=60.0`:
```
§CINEMA_DIVE ... fanMin=60.0 fanMax=60.0 fanMean=60.0 ... enclosed=0%
§CINEMA_CORNERS ... rMin=15.00 rMax=15.00 maxDeviation=7.50m
```
That is **"unknown"**, not "60 metres of space" — but the rounding read it as a measurement, fell
through to the 40%-of-leg cap, and cut **7.50m inside a hand-placed waypoint**. G8 "passed" only by
comparing that cut against the same fictional 60m. **Terminal was in the same state (`2/2` corners
unmeasured), so its earlier G8 pass was vacuous too** — `clear=60.00m` was printed in the run log and
read past. Fixed: no-hit → UNKNOWN → capped at the existing 3m nudge budget (Terminal's corner radius
4.80→3.00m, deviation 2.40→1.50m), and G8 hardened so measured corners must fit the measurement while
unmeasured ones must obey the cap. **Lesson worth keeping: a sentinel value that is numerically
plausible will pass a gate that compares against it. The live run found it; the headless suite could
not, because it was grading itself with the same sentinel.**

**Log hygiene fixed in the same pass:** `§CINEMA_CORNERS` fired on every `pointermove` (dozens of
identical rows/second in the user's paste) — now only on a shape change or once a second, and it names
`unmeasuredCorners=n/m`. `§CPE_HOLD` no longer re-logs an unchanged hold. `§MAXQ_START` is printed
before the editor opens, so `§MAXQ_START_REVISED` now prints when an edit changes the frame count.

**UI feedback, user-directed same session** (*"status feedback, the buttons should pulse louder perhaps
some orange"*): held waypoint is ORANGE and breathes continuously at 12Hz — throttled deliberately, an
every-frame `markDirty()` would defeat the renderer's idle parking for as long as a point is held (63k
elements on Hospital). A 300ms settle was wrong here: a frozen canvas with a static dot is exactly the
state that reads as a hang. Buttons now carry the status — OK turns orange and breathes when an edit is
queued, "Save this path" lights only when there is something to save, reports `Path saved` and does NOT
close the editor (staging is not recording), and a state line answers "what happens if I stop now?".
Blue waypoints kept clearly visible — the user initially read them as non-functional, then corrected
themselves (*"those 2 blue dots is part of the scene"*), so they are secondary, not de-emphasised away.

### Still open on this lane
- ~~The editor has not been driven by hand in a real browser~~ — **DONE 2026-07-27, see §CPE_LIVE.**
  Still unexercised by hand: ctrl+drag (height), the total-seconds field, and "Save this path" →
  `Ctrl+S` → reopen. Only xz-drag, row-click hold and double-click release have live evidence.
- `witness_cinema_path_editor.js` runs Duplex + Terminal only. Hospital/JKR/LTU_AHouse unrun.

## §CPE_SCREEN_PLANE — BUILT (user, 2026-07-27). Supersedes model items 13-17
> *"Whenever user touch canvas, it reacts without double click... user does that to adjust it to be
> 'facing' so that the dot when moved is merely facing X/Y ranging. Ie the dot when touched, can only
> move in that Xy sense."* … *"u only move up/down left/right, thus u merely adjust your canvas to be
> facing correctly first."*

**The canvas is NEVER frozen.** A drag on a handle moves it in the CAMERA'S OWN VIEW PLANE; everything
else falls through to OrbitControls. Drag and orbit are told apart by the hit-test on pointerdown, not
by a mode.

Why this is better than what it replaced: the freeze only ever existed because dragging and orbiting
competed for one gesture. Resolving that by hit-test instead of by mode **deletes** the freeze, the
double-click release, the touch double-tap, and ctrl+drag-for-height — height is now just a drag from
a side view. Mobile works for free, since nothing depends on a modifier key. Item 17 ("the held state
must be unmistakable, a frozen canvas reads as a hang") is moot: nothing freezes.

### Grab zones — BUILT as specified, with one cosmetic gap
User check, 2026-07-27: *"touching pipe end will pivot its end. Touching mid will take whole length
without pivoting."* **That behaviour is in and verified on merged main:**
`zones = [{p:e[0],z:'a'}, {p:b.c,z:'mid'}, {p:e[1],z:'b'}]`; an end calls `_rotateAbout(b, d.z==='b', p)`
(pivot about the far end, length invariant), `mid` translates the whole band.

⚠ **Cosmetic gap, NOT behavioural — the only thing outstanding on the editor.** The *band* is drawn as
a thin line (`_mkLine`); only the *film* is drawn as a tube. So you grab a small sphere sitting at the
band's end rather than the pipe end itself. Functionally identical today because a band is only
~1–1.3m, so its three spheres span it — but it does not READ as a pipe with grabbable ends, which is
how the user describes it. Fix is small: render each band with `TubeGeometry` at a slightly larger
radius than the film tube, and extend the hit-test from three points to "nearest third of the band's
screen-space length" so the whole pipe is grabbable rather than three dots on it.

**Inherent cost, accepted by the user:** from a top-down view you cannot change height, and from a side
view you cannot move along the view axis. Some moves take two steps — orbit, then drag. That IS the
workflow, not a defect.

## §CPE_PACING_BUILT — derived duration, BUILT and MEASURED 2026-07-27
Every beat is now a measured distance or angle over a stated rate. Frame count follows the plan
(`cinema_maxq` derives `nFrames` from `plan.naturalTotal`) instead of setting it.

| beat | rate | source quantity |
|---|---|---|
| walk | `CINEMA_WALK_MPS` 1.3 m/s | flown path length |
| pull-back | `CINEMA_PULLBACK_MPS` 6.5 m/s | orbitRadius − exit radius |
| dive | `CINEMA_DIVE_MPS` 20 m/s | approach distance, **capped at the envelope** |
| spin | `CINEMA_TURN_DPS` 45°/s | turn angle, **capped at 180°** |
| orbit | `CINEMA_TURN_DPS` 45°/s | one 360° lap = 8.0s |

Beat FRACTIONS are derived-seconds over the natural total, so they no longer depend on `durationSec`
at all — which is what makes "set the total and the whole clip scales uniformly" true by construction
rather than by arithmetic in the editor.

### ⚠ dive distance and spin angle are NOT building properties
They are properties of **where the user was standing** when Alt+C was pressed. Measured on
LTU_AHouse: a **746m approach** and a **522° spin**, producing a 93.6s film of which 37.3s was dive and
11.6s spin. Pacing them raw makes runtime depend on the user's pose, which contradicts the entire
premise. Hence the caps — approach at the envelope, spin at a half turn (the most ever needed to face
anywhere). This distinction is the real finding of the pacing work: **walk and pull-back are building
properties; dive and spin are pose properties; the orbit is a constant lap.**

### Measured derived totals (2026-07-27, warm headless rig)
| building | total | frames@15 | dive | spin | walk | pull-back | orbit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duplex (DX) | **26.1s** | 392 | 2.5 | 0.8 | 9.7 | 5.1 | 8.0 |
| JKR | 32.8s | 492 | 3.0 | 1.0 | 14.3 | 6.5 | 8.0 |
| Terminal | 39.1s | 586 | 3.4 | 0.8 | 19.5 | 7.4 | 8.0 |
| LTU_AHouse (LTU) | **55.4s** | 832 | 6.7 | 4.0 | 23.0 | 13.7 | 8.0 |

### 🔎 WHAT TO LOOK AT NEXT — the totals do not match the ~15s/~40s expectation
Duplex lands at 26.1s against ~15s; LTU at 55.4s against ~40s. **The ratio is right (2.1× vs the
expected 2.7×); the offset is not.** The arithmetic says exactly where it goes: walk + pull-back ALONE
give **14.8s and 36.7s** — almost exactly the expectation. Everything above that is dive + spin +
orbit, and the **orbit's fixed 8.0s lap is the single largest constant on a small building** (8 of
Duplex's 26.1s).
So the open question is not "derived or fixed" — that is settled and built — but **whether the orbit
lap and the arrival belong inside the number the user was picturing.** Three ways to close it, none
picked:
1. The expectation counted only the interior act + recede; the orbit is extra. Nothing to change —
   just report totals split as "film 14.8s + orbit 8s".
2. The orbit lap should be faster on small buildings (rate scaled by envelope rather than a constant
   45°/s).
3. `CINEMA_WALK_MPS` / `CINEMA_PULLBACK_MPS` want tuning together, which moves both endpoints.
**Measure before choosing** — the table above is the baseline to move against.

## §CPE_BANDS_BUILT — implemented and witnessed 2026-07-27 (`feat/cinema-path-editor` @ `5eb69df`)
All of §CPE_BANDS below is BUILT, plus the full-film tube. New file gates:
`witness_cinema_bands.js` **6/6 on Duplex AND Terminal** — these REPLACE G7/G8/G10, which assumed
corner-fillet geometry over free waypoints; that green was re-earned, not carried.
`witness_cinema_path_editor.js` 9/9 both (loose waypoints still supported).
`witness_cinema_path_persist.js` 7/7 against the 3-band schema, round-trip through a real page reload.
`witness_cinema_orbit_v2.js` PASS (regression check on the shipped derived path).

| gate | result |
|---|---|
| B1/B2 bands flown straight at exactly their authored length | err ≤ 2.2e-16, nothing inserted inside a band |
| B3 curve leaves/arrives ALONG each band direction | ≤ 10° at every join |
| B4 connector bow ≤ measured clearance (or the conservative cap where unknown) | bow 0.26–0.29m vs clearance 0.86m |
| B5 no sharp corners, seeded layout | ≤ 12°/frame cap met on both buildings |
| B6 fold | 3 bands → 6 waypoints → flown as authored |
| B7 LOS runs along the band | passes outside the deliberate look-back blend |

### ⚠ THREE LATENT DEFECTS IN SHIPPED CODE, exposed by band geometry — all measured, all fixed
None of these were introduced by bands; bands merely reached them. Each was predicted arithmetically
and then confirmed against a measurement, per the FUNDAMENTAL LAW.
1. **`_cinemaGazeBlend` chose the look-back's turn direction with a PER-FRAME test.** The frame
   `|dYaw|` crossed `CINEMA_TURN_ANTIPODAL_RAD`, `dYaw` moved by 2π and the gaze snapped by `2π × w`.
   At the observed frame `e3=0.906` → `turnW3=0.341` → predicted `2π × 0.341 = 123°`; **measured
   118°/frame**. Fixed by taking the representative of the raw delta NEAREST a per-plan reference —
   continuous, and still lands exactly on the pivot bearing at w=1 (which Beat 4's handoff needs).
   ⚠ A first attempt (freezing the plus-way branch as a per-plan constant) made it WORSE — 178°/frame,
   sustained. Recorded so nobody retries it.
2. **The look-ahead collapse guard measured HORIZONTAL distance only.** Any near-vertical stretch of
   path tripped it while the look-ahead was metres away — just above rather than ahead. Terminal's
   walk-out climbs ~17m with x/z barely moving: target jumped `(-0.80,-6.19,-1.14)` →
   `(-21.82,-25.65,-1.67)`, **113°/frame at t=0.411**. Now a 3D test — what the guard always meant.
3. **The spin's destination bearing came from the next waypoint even with no horizontal baseline.**
   With bands that waypoint is the settle band's own far end, short and near-vertical → **27°/frame at
   the Beat2→3 seam**. Guarded with the same 0.5m the look-ahead guard uses; a normal door-length
   first leg is untouched, so the derived film is unchanged there.

**Net:** seeded band path went 118 → **9.8°/frame** (Duplex), i.e. bands now fly *smoother than the
derived route* (9.8 vs 12.5). Terminal derived measures 11.3.

**Behaviour change to be aware of:** fix (2) alters the DERIVED film on any building whose walk-out
has a near-vertical stretch (Terminal does). That is a defect removal, not a regression — but it is a
visible change, so do not expect frame-identical output to pre-`5eb69df` on such buildings.

### Residual, NOT gated
An adversarial layout (three bands aimed away from each other, forcing the path to double back twice)
peaks at **30.9°/frame** with a total turn of ~365° over 89 frames (mean 4.1). Printed as `INFO` by
the witness rather than gated: a near-reversal genuinely cannot be flown as gently as a normal route,
and pretending otherwise would mean weakening the gate that protects the realistic case. Revisit only
if a real user path hits it.

## §CPE_BANDS — the spec (settled with the user 2026-07-27) — IMPLEMENTED, see above
**Read this before touching the editor again.** Settled in discussion; user quotes inline. Supersedes
the "3 draggable points" shape in §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR_MODEL — the *data model* (waypoints only, LOS
aim, constant speed) is unchanged; what changes is that each anchor becomes a rigid **band**.

### The idea
> *"Let the first not a point but a band... a stretch say about 5% of the inside... so is the exit...
> by manipulating that, u can have creative curves"*

A point gives position only. A band gives position **and direction** — its two ends are a tangent, and
tangents are what actually shape a curve. That is the whole reason this is worth building.

### The rules (all settled, do not re-litigate)
1. **Three bands, one per existing anchor:** settle, wp1(exit door), stop. No bands added or removed.
2. **A band is a SHORT STRAIGHT segment.** > *"the bands are short straight parts of the path. When
   they are moved their length and straightness does not morph.. keep that steady for now."*
   Rigid. Dragging never bends or resizes one.
3. **Grab zones:** > *"when clicking on one end it pivots.. in the middle it is the whole length moving
   as one."* End = pure ROTATION about the far end (not a resize — length is invariant).
   Middle = translation of the whole band.
4. **Length is therefore NOT draggable** → it needs a number field on the row. The "5% of the inside"
   seed is the actual length, not just a starting size (I initially got this wrong and was corrected).
5. **6 waypoints, folded into 3 rows.** > *"in a way the 3 bands are actually 6 waypoints"* … *"but
   efficiently folded into 3."* The table stays 3 rows. The flown path expands to 6 points at plan
   time, flies, and discards them.
6. **STORE 3 BANDS, NOT 6 POINTS.** `cinema_path` becomes 3 rows of (anchor xyz, direction, length).
   Rigidity then survives save/reload **structurally** — six free points would just be six points, free
   to bend apart on the next session. Safe to change the schema: no building in the wild has the table
   (every restore to date logs `§CINEMA_PATH_RESTORE none`).
7. **Bands are highly movable, and the path must re-form.** > *"user can drag it to a far end, the path
   has to bounce back."* No placement limits. Connector curvature scales with its own span, so a 5m gap
   and a 60m gap both read as one continuous curve.
8. **Authored is authored.** Drag a band through a wall and the camera goes through the wall — the same
   settled doctrine that already governs the derived straight-line route, and it applies more strongly
   to a point placed by hand. Do not add collision fighting.

### Geometry consequences — this REPLACES the corner-fillet approach
- **No rounding INSIDE a band** — that is the straight part; rounding it is the morphing rule 2 forbids.
- **The connector between two bands is tangent-matched at BOTH ends**: it leaves a band along that
  band's own direction and arrives at the next along that one's. A cubic Hermite whose tangents ARE the
  band directions and whose handle length scales with the span. If the connector arrives from any other
  direction you get a kink exactly at the band end — the opposite of the goal.
- The `A.cinemaFan` clearance bound still caps how far a connector may bow. Note it is WEAK outside
  (the fan sees no geometry there, so the conservative cap applies, not a measurement — see §CPE_LIVE).
- `_cinemaRoundCorners` (effects.js) is therefore superseded for the authored path; keep it for the
  derived path or replace both, but do not run it across band interiors.

### Still open on bands
- **Does the camera TRAVEL the settle band during the spin?** Asked, not answered. Travelling it gives
  the drift-and-look that the settled *"no robotic abrupt stop and turn"* ruling asks for, but changes a
  beat that has existing witnesses. My recommendation: travel it, after first confirming no witness
  asserts a stationary spin.
- Dive origin and orbit are still NOT authorable. §CPE_LIVE's complaint is only half closed by the tube
  (visible ≠ editable). Decide later whether they become bands 4 and 5.

### Also asked, also NOT YET BUILT — the full-film tube
> *"the whole flight path must be visible… Render the FULL path as one continuous highlighted curve —
> dive origin → settle → wp1 → stop → orbit… Dragging any of the three must re-derive and re-render
> that whole curve live."* And: *"the flight path should a thicker perhaps blue/yellow pipe depending on
> background colour to contrast."*

Draw it by sampling `plan.poseAt(t)` across t=0..1 — that curve IS the flown film, so it cannot drift
from what the bake flies. Tube geometry, colour chosen against background luminance (yellow on dark,
blue on light), re-checked on background toggle.
**Perf is NOT a blocker — measured, warm:** re-plan 13ms Duplex, 82ms Terminal; sampling 240 poses
0.3ms. (The `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS 456.8` in a live log was a COLD first plan — do not design around it.)

### Engineering risk assessment (asked directly: "is the engineering of the 3 bands an issue?")
Not mathematically. The constrained Hermite is craft, not research. The real risks are process:
1. **G7/G8/G10 are invalidated by construction** — they assume free waypoints + corner fillets. That
   green is RE-EARNED, not carried. Rewrite them for band+connector before claiming the feature works.
2. **Another session owns `_cinemaPathPlan`'s §CINEMA_SPACE block (~L3486-3610)** — keep the footprint
   outside it, as the current implementation already does.
3. **Sequence bands and pacing separately.** Both touch timing; landed together it is impossible to say
   which change moved which number.

## §CPE_PACING — total duration must be DERIVED, not fixed (user, 2026-07-27). MEASURED, ONE DECISION OPEN
Consolidated user ask, three parts:
1. **Interior:** slower constant m/s, re-applied on every edit so dragging always retimes to hold it.
2. **Exterior:** pull back from NEAR to the final orbit distance, rather than starting far.
3. **Total:** falls out of (1) and (2) applied to each building's real geometry — not one fixed number.
   Expectation to CHECK, not to hit: small (DX) ≈ 15s, large (LTU) ≈ 40s.

### The current model is inverted — measured, not asserted
Today total is fixed (360 frames / 15fps = 24s) and speed is whatever makes the derived walk fit
`CINEMA_OUT_SEC`=6s. So **the bigger the building, the faster the camera**: Duplex 2.10 m/s, JKR 3.10,
Terminal 4.22, LTU_AHouse 4.99. Exactly backwards. Frames must become a CONSEQUENCE of duration, not
its cause (`cinema_maxq.js` currently derives duration from `nFrames`).

### Measured geometry (2026-07-27, warm, headless ANGLE rig)
| building | walk pathLen | envelope | near R | final R | pull-back | lap @finalR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duplex | 12.6m | 50.0 | 11.6 | 45.0 | **33.4m** | 282.7m |
| JKR | 18.6m | 60.3 | 12.0 | 54.3 | 42.3m | 341.3m |
| Terminal | 25.3m | 67.8 | 12.9 | 61.0 | 48.1m | 383.3m |
| LTU_AHouse | 29.9m | 134.6 | 32.1 | 121.1 | **89.0m** | 761.1m |

Duplex→LTU: pull-back 2.7×, envelope 2.7×. The user's 15s→40s expectation is 2.7×. **The ratio is
already present in the real measurements** — nothing needs inventing to produce it.

### The result that decides the design
Taking ONLY the two quantities the user named — interior walk at a constant **1.3 m/s**, exterior
pull-back at **6.5 m/s**:

| | walk | pull-back | sum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Duplex | 9.7s | 5.1s | **14.8s** |
| JKR | 14.3s | 6.5s | 20.8s |
| Terminal | 19.5s | 7.4s | 26.9s |
| LTU_AHouse | 23.0s | 13.7s | **36.7s** |

14.8s vs the ~15s expectation, 36.7s vs ~40s. **These constants were not tuned to hit those numbers** —
they are measured path length and measured pull-back distance over two stated speeds.

### ⛔ THE ONE OPEN DECISION — ask the user first, do not guess
The three beats above are still FIXED: dive 6s + spin 2s + orbit 8s = **a 16s floor**, which alone
exceeds the 15s small-building expectation. Add them back unchanged and totals become 30.8s (Duplex)
and 52.7s (LTU), and the spread collapses from 2.5× to 1.7× — i.e. the expectation is only met if those
three ALSO stop being fixed seconds.
**Question put to the user, unanswered at session end:** do dive / spin / orbit become derived too —
dive paced by its real approach distance, spin by its real turn angle, orbit by a constant angular rate
— or do they stay fixed and the real totals land nearer 31s and 53s?
⚠ Note `CINEMA_DIVE_SEC`'s comment says the dive is deliberately time-boxed and *"never clamped, never
distance-proportional"* (§CINEMA_SIMPLE). Deriving it CONTRADICTS a settled ruling — that is exactly why
this is a user decision and not an implementation choice.

## THE FOUNDATION — read these, do NOT re-derive them
This feature is only cheap because the substrate already exists and is proven. Referenced, not
restated; go to the source for detail.

| what | where | why it matters here |
|---|---|---|
| The plan itself | `viewer/effects.js` `_cinemaPathPlan()` → `{beats:{dive,spin,out,rise}, poseAt(t), pivot, exit, ...}` | Every pose is a pure function of `t`. **Both** consumers — live capture (`effects.js`) and the MaxQ bake (`cinema_maxq.js`) — read this ONE plan, so editing its inputs changes both for free. |
| The editable inputs | same file: `CINEMA_DIVE/SPIN/OUT/RISE_SEC`, `outWp` waypoints, `CINEMA_EYE_M`, `CINEMA_LOOKDOWN_DEG`, the orbit radius band | This is the actual edit surface. Nothing else needs to become editable. |
| The gap to put the dialog in | `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS` — Alt+C already pauses to compute (Duplex ~50–100 ms; Terminal/Hospital 500–750 ms) | No new entry point is needed or wanted. |
| The route renderer to REUSE | `viewer/navigate_find.js:1249 _drawPathHighlight`, `:3274 _renderPathResult` | The Find panel already draws a room route as a line through points; `outWp` is the same shape of data. |
| The persistence pattern to MIRROR | `staffage_instances` — `viewer/scene.js:577 _writeStaffageTable` / `:589 _exportBuildingDb`, `effects.js A._restoreStaffageInstances` | Full round-trip measured working 2026-07-26: `§STAFFAGE_SAVE rows=8` → `§STAFFAGE_RESTORE rows=8` → `restored=8`. See `prompts/STAFFAGE_WALKABLE_PLACEMENT.md §STAFFAGE_PERSIST`. |
| Recent path fixes that must not regress | `prompts/PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md` §CINEMA_TURN_SLERP (#1018) and §CINEMA_DAMPING_BLEED (#1020) | Their witnesses (`witness_cinema_exit_breathe.js`, `witness_cinema_damping_bleed.js`) must stay green after any change to the plan or its consumers. |

## Scope guardrails (the "simplest fastest" requirement is the spec, not a preference)
1. **No new icon, no new panel, no new keybinding.** It rides the Alt+C press that already exists.
2. **OK must behave exactly like today** — same film, same beats. The default cost of this feature is
   one click. If OK changes the output at all, the feature is wrong.
3. **Reuse the Find route renderer.** Do NOT build a second path-drawing system, and do NOT build an
   in-viewport 3D drag gizmo. A dialog with a 2D graph is the deliverable.
4. **An edited path is AUTHORED data, not derived.** Under the prime rule (EXTRACT OR COMPILE ONLY) it
   must be STORED, never re-guessed: a `cinema_path` table (beats + waypoints + eye height + tilt)
   written by `_exportBuildingDb()` and read on load. Reuse the staffage pattern; do not invent a
   second persistence mechanism.
5. **Persistence is an EXPLICIT action — "Save this path" (user directive 2026-07-26).** Adjusting and
   proceeding is *ephemeral*: this film, this press, nothing written. Only "Save this path" marks the
   edit as the building's stored path. Mechanically this mirrors staffage exactly — the action stages
   the path into the in-memory DB and the user's normal `Ctrl+S` carries it to the file, the same way
   `_writeStaffageTable()` runs at `_exportBuildingDb()` time. Do NOT add a second save route, and do
   NOT auto-persist on adjust: a user experimenting with waypoints must be able to walk away without
   having changed the building.
   Dialog affordances, therefore: **OK** (proceed, unchanged) · **Save this path** (stage the edit) ·
   **Cancel** (abandon, no recording).

## Witness claims (spec-first — write these before any implementation)
- **G1** OK-without-edit is a no-op: beats and sampled `poseAt(t)` are byte-identical to a run with
  the dialog bypassed. (The one gate that protects the zero-friction default.)
- **G2** a waypoint edit changes the sampled path at that waypoint and nowhere else.
- **G3** a camera-Z edit changes eye height by exactly the amount asked, on every affected beat.
- **G4** round-trip: edit → **Save this path** → `_exportBuildingDb()` → `_openDbBytes()` → the SAME
  edited path is in force, proven by SAMPLED POSES, not by the table merely existing.
- **G4b** ephemerality: edit → proceed WITHOUT "Save this path" → export/reopen → the plan is the
  unedited derived one. Adjusting must not silently mutate the building.
- **G5** control: on a DB with no `cinema_path` table the plan is the unedited derived one.
- **G6** §CINEMA_TURN_SLERP's and §CINEMA_DAMPING_BLEED's witnesses stay green.

## §CINEMA_ATTIC_PICK — the dive target ⛔ REASSIGNED, NOT THIS SESSION'S (user, 2026-07-26)
> **"ignore the default attic issue — as another session is handling."**
>
> The "do this FIRST" ordering below is therefore VOID for this file's lane, and the §CINEMA_SPACE block
> in `_cinemaPathPlan` (~L3486-3610) is **another session's working set** — the path-editor work must not
> edit it. Kept below only as the reference record of what that other lane owns. The editor is designed
> so it does not care which room the picker chooses: the settle point is just waypoint 1, draggable.

<details><summary>original folded-in brief (now another session's)</summary>

**Do this FIRST, before the dialog.** Not a priority argument to re-run — the reasoning is simply that
this editor's value is inversely proportional to how often it is needed: a good default makes the
dialog a one-click OK (the differentiator), a bad default makes editing mandatory (just a worse
conventional tool). Fixing the default first also gives the dialog's G1 no-op gate something worth
being a no-op about.

**Symptom:** the dive "goes for the attic" — the camera settles in a top-level/roof void instead of a
real occupiable space.

**What the picker actually does today** (`viewer/effects.js` §CINEMA_SPACE, ~line 3386): ranks ALL
room-graph nodes with rects by `area / (1 + dCtr / (envelope*0.5))` — "largest space nearest the
centre" — takes the single top-ranked one, applies ONE enclosure sanity check, and falls to
bbox-centre if that fails. Live JKR evidence from the user's own log:
```
§CINEMA_SPACE cand=0pNy6pOyf7JPmXRLgxs3sW area=135.2 enclosed=0%   mep=0% chosen=false
§CINEMA_SPACE cand=0BTBFw6f90Nfh9rP1dlXr2 area=27.7  enclosed=100% mep=0% chosen=true (rank=2, skipped 1 disqualified above)
```
So the enclosure gate DOES fire and DOES skip candidates — meaning an attic that reads `enclosed=100%`
will win on area alone. Start by capturing the same `§CINEMA_SPACE` lines on a building that actually
exhibits the attic dive; do not theorise from JKR, which chose a 27.7 m² room.

**⚠ ANTI-DRIFT — do NOT "fix" this by adding floor-level weighting.** That was explicitly ruled out by
the user on 2026-07-20 and the ruling is quoted in the code's own comment: *"abandon the 'next largest
room' idea... It is disastrous for sure. Just back to original 'go to largest space within 4 sec'."*
There is deliberately **no** floor-level weighting and no multi-candidate search. A fix must come from
a different angle — e.g. a stronger occupiability probe (headroom, real floor beneath, reachability
from the room graph) — not from re-ranking by storey. Re-read that comment block before touching it.

</details>

## Out of scope — each has its own session, do not fold them in here
- `§STAFFAGE_PAX_REJECT tried=72 placed=3` with all rejection counters 0 — 69 unattributed
  rejections, the reason only ~3 figures ever appear. `prompts/STAFFAGE_WALKABLE_PLACEMENT.md`.
- **Scene jumping on reopen** — NOT reproduced through `_openDbBytes()` (camera 0.00 m, target
  0.00 m). Needs the user's actual repro route first.
- **D2 walk-out corner whip** — 19.8°/frame on current main, printed by the witness, not gated.
- **JKR path-crossing** — `prompts/Modeller/DISC_Walker/VIEWER_FIND_PANEL_ROOM_ACCURACY.md` §18.

## Two small already-diagnosed items to land alongside (both root-caused, neither started)
- **Restore staffage on LOAD**, not on the first Alt+P press. The round-trip works; the trigger is
  wrong. Details + measurements: `STAFFAGE_WALKABLE_PLACEMENT.md §STAFFAGE_PERSIST` (ANSWERED section).
- **MP4 loses one pixel row** on odd-height canvases: frames grabbed at `w×h`, encoder configured at
  `(w & ~1, h & ~1)`, drawn 1:1. `cinema_maxq.js` `_stitchMp4`.

## §CPE_OK_CRASH — OK after an edit kills the bake (user live run, Hospital, 2026-07-27)

**SPEC FIRST. Do not implement before reading this section.** Reported by the user immediately after
§CPE_SCREEN_PLANE landed: *"satisfied the 'pipe band 2 waypoints with mid translatable' working..
however hits error when OK the editor box"*. The grab model itself is fine — the drag worked, the
editor closed, the plan re-derived. The bake is what died.

### The user's own console, the three lines that matter
```
§CPE_CLOSE action=ok edited=true total=54.4s
§CPE_LOCKS re-claimed for the bake (maxqActive=true)
§CINEMA_PATH_EDIT authored waypoints=6 (derived route replaced) orbitScale=0.991 orbitDY=-0.90m
§MAXQ_WAKELOCK acquired (screen stays awake for the bake)
[S274] §ERR_PROMISE Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: ... at Object.start [as startMaxQualityOrbit] (cinema_maxq.js)
```
The re-plan SUCCEEDED — `§CINEMA_PATH_EDIT authored waypoints=6` is the edited path being flown. The
throw is one line later, in the log statement that reports what just happened.

### Root cause — a stale log line, not a stale path
`cinema_maxq.js:507` (the `§CPE_APPLIED` line) reads `_cpeRes.override.waypoints.length`. That field
**no longer exists**: §CPE_BANDS changed `cinema_path_editor.js` `_buildOverride()` to return
`{ bands, diveSec, spinSec, outSec, riseSec, _total, _naturalTotal, _scale, _pathLen }` — bands, not
waypoints. `effects.js` was ported (it reads `ov.bands` and expands via `_cinemaBandWaypoints`, which
is why the plan is correct); the one consumer in `cinema_maxq.js` was not.

**Why review missed it and the witnesses missed it:** `witness_cinema_bands.js` drives
`A.cinemaPathPlan(dur, override)` directly — the plan seam, not the bake. Nothing in the suite ever
walks the actual user path *editor OK → `start()` continues → bake*. The one line of code between
those two is exactly where the defect sat. (This is `feedback_test_real_user_path_not_seams` charging
its rent a second time.)

**Blast radius: total.** Every edited path is unbakeable on shipped main; only the untouched-OK
guardrail-2 path survives, because that branch never dereferences the override. §CPE_SCREEN_PLANE
therefore shipped a feature whose entire purpose — edit, then record — cannot complete.

### The fix
Report the count the plan actually flew, derived from the shape the editor actually returns:
`bands.length * 2` for a band override (§CPE_BANDS rule: 3 bands fold to 6 waypoints), falling back
to `waypoints.length` if a legacy loose-waypoint override is ever handed in, and to `?` if neither.
No behaviour change to the path, the plan or the bake — this is a log line, and it must stay one.

### Witness — `witness_cpe_ok_bake.js`, the missing user path
Runs Duplex + Terminal. Each gate names what it proves or disproves:
- **K1 (the reported crash)** — open the real editor, KEY a real band edit (the `y` field, the same
  state mutation a drag makes), click the real `#cpe-ok`, and let `start()` continue. PASS = zero
  page errors and the run reaches the bake. FAIL = the `TypeError` above. This gate is RED on
  `origin/main` by construction; if it is not, the fix is not the fix.
- **K2 (the log tells the truth)** — `§CPE_APPLIED waypoints=N` must EQUAL the `N` in the
  `§CINEMA_PATH_EDIT authored waypoints=N` printed by the plan it just built. Not crashing is not
  enough: a hardcoded `0` would also not crash and would lie in every future bug report.
- **K3 (guardrail 2 unbroken)** — OK with NO edit still reaches the bake and still logs
  `§CPE_APPLIED none`. Proves the fix did not move the crash into the other branch.
- The bake is cancelled at frame 0 (`startMaxQualityOrbit()` re-entry sets `_cancel`) so the gate
  costs seconds, not the full cook. Reaching `§MAXQ_IDB_READY`/`§MAXQ_CANCEL i=0` IS "reached the
  bake" — everything past line 507 that the crash denied.

### Measured — RED then GREEN, same rig, same gates (2026-07-27, `fix/cpe-ok-override-crash`)
Headless ANGLE/SwiftShader, local server on 8402, real editor DOM, real `startMaxQualityOrbit`.

**On `origin/main` (unpatched), Duplex — 1/3:**
```
FAIL K1  editorOpened=true edit=-0.47→1.03m reachedBake=false pageErrors=1
         ← THE REPORTED CRASH: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
         applied: (§CPE_APPLIED never printed)
FAIL K2  §CPE_APPLIED waypoints=n/a vs §CINEMA_PATH_EDIT authored waypoints=6
PASS K3  untouched OK reaches the bake — the crash only ever hit EDITED paths
```
**With the fix — 3/3 Duplex AND 3/3 Terminal:**
```
Duplex    K1 reachedBake=true pageErrors=0 | §CPE_APPLIED total=26.5s frames=26 waypoints=6
Terminal  K1 reachedBake=true pageErrors=0 | §CPE_APPLIED total=40.1s frames=40 waypoints=6
both      K2 §CPE_APPLIED waypoints=6 == §CINEMA_PATH_EDIT authored waypoints=6
both      K3 §CPE_APPLIED none — derived plan unchanged
```
K3 passing RED is the diagnosis in one line: only the edited branch dereferenced the dead field.
Regression: `witness_cinema_bands.js` **6/6** on Duplex, unchanged.

### The bug reporter half — NOT this branch
The user's next sentence (*"Error submission hits error in Gmail should have send via GH"*) is the
same defect class — the mailto path had no URL length cap while the GitHub path has capped at 8000
since §S280 — but it is **owned by another session and already shipped as PR #1028** (cascades the
log-line count until the URL fits ~1800 chars; measured 8202 → 1561). Do not re-fix it here.

## §CPE_PANEL_DRAG — the editor panel is draggable (user, 2026-07-27)

User, after firing a full run: *"happy with how editor behaves.. but can u make the editor panel
draggable"*. The panel is anchored `position:fixed; top:60px; right:12px` and covers a fixed 412px
strip of the viewport — exactly where the bands often sit once the user has orbited to face the axes
they want to drag in (§CPE_SCREEN_PLANE makes "turn to face the plane" the normal gesture, so the
panel WILL end up over the handles).

### Reuse, do not invent — this is model item 14's rule applied to the panel itself
`A._makeDraggable(el)` (`measure.js:13`) is this viewer's ONE panel-drag utility: ~10 panels already
use it (`navigate_find`, `panels`, `issues`, `clash_matrix`, `grid_overlay`, `print_sheet`, `hba_lens`,
`measure` ×2). It grabs the top `el._dragStrip` px (30 desktop / 50 mobile, overridable), arms on
pointerdown but only captures after 4px of movement (so a stationary tap still reaches child
controls), and switches the panel from its right-anchor to free `left/top`. **Do not write a second
one**, and do not edit `_makeDraggable` — it is shared by every one of those panels.

Applied here as: the header div gets `id="cpe-title"` + `cursor:move`, and `_dragStrip = 36` so the
grab zone is exactly the header — the rows below it carry number inputs whose keyed edits must never
fling the panel.

### Why this cannot disturb the path — the thing actually worth gating
`_wire()` installs `pointermove`/`pointerup` on **window** (capture phase). Those are the handlers
that move a band. They are guarded by `_state.drag`, which is only ever set by `h.down` — and `h.down`
is bound to **the canvas alone**. So a header drag cannot become a band drag. That is an argument;
the witness makes it a measurement.

### Scope note, stated not smuggled
Beyond the literal ask, the dragged position is **remembered for the session** (module-scope
`_panelPos`, re-applied on the next open). A panel that forgets where you put it every time Alt+M
re-opens it is a half-feature. It is three lines, it is gated (D4), and it is called out here rather
than slipped in. Nothing is persisted to the DB — this is not `cinema_path` state.

### Witness — `witness_cpe_panel_drag.js`, Duplex + Terminal
- **D1 the ask** — pointerdown on `#cpe-title`, move by a known (dx, dy), pointerup: the panel's
  `getBoundingClientRect()` must have moved by EXACTLY that delta (±1px). Proves the drag is wired
  and 1:1 — a scaled or offset drag would still "look draggable" and be wrong under the hand.
- **D2 the risk** — that same drag must leave the path untouched: **no `§CPE_DRAG` line**, and band
  centres bit-identical before and after. Disproves the window-level-handler collision above.
- **D3 the grab zone** — an identical drag started on a ROW (below the strip) must NOT move the
  panel. Proves keyed edits and row clicks can't fling it.
- **D4 the scope note** — after close and re-open, the panel is back where the user left it.

### Measured — 4/4 Duplex AND 4/4 Terminal (2026-07-27, `feat/cpe-draggable-panel`)
```
D1  panel (976,60) -> (1156,180) = moved (180.0,120.0), asked (180,120)
    §CPE_PANEL_DRAGGABLE handle=cpe-title strip=36 at default anchor
    §CPE_PANEL_MOVED dx=180 dy=120 left=1156 top=180 (remembered for this session)
D2  §CPE_DRAG lines 0 -> 0 | band centres IDENTICAL before and after
D3  panel (1156,180) -> (1156,180) = moved (0.0,0.0) when the drag starts on a row
D4  left at (1156,180), re-opened at (1156,180)
```
**A witness bug worth recording, since it will bite the next puppeteer gate here:**
`page.evaluate(() => window.APP.startMaxQualityOrbit(...))` with a CONCISE arrow body RETURNS the
bake's promise, so `evaluate` waits for the entire cook and dies on `protocolTimeout` after 180s —
it looks exactly like a hung viewer. Use a BLOCK body (`() => { ...; }`) so nothing is returned.

## §CPE_SAVED_PATH_LIFECYCLE — "when Saved the edited path, how do we open it?" (user, 2026-07-27)

Answered from the code, end to end. **There is no "open" action, by design — a saved path is not a
document you load, it is state the plan picks up.**

| step | what actually happens | log line |
|---|---|---|
| "Save this path" | `cinema_path_editor.js:664` → `A.stageCinemaPath(_buildOverride())` sets `A._cinemaPathEdit` **in memory only**. Editor stays open — staging is not closing. | `§CINEMA_PATH_STAGE` |
| **Ctrl+S** (Save Building; `scene.js:2136`, also the panel item at `panels.js:1302`) | `A.saveModelDb()` → `_exportBuildingDb()` → `_writeCinemaPathTable()` drops+rewrites a `cinema_path` table — one row per band (IFC anchor, unit dir, length) plus the beat seconds. | `§CINEMA_PATH_SAVE bands=3 total=…s` |
| next Alt+M on that file | `A.cinemaPathPlan()` calls `_cpeLoadFromDb()` **lazily at the first plan** — before anything can observe the derived route — and rebuilds the bands. The editor then opens on the user's path. | `§CINEMA_PATH_RESTORE bands=3 total=…s — authored path in force` (or `none (no cinema_path table) — derived path`) |

### Two consequences the user needs stated, not discovered
1. **It is per-FILE, and a building served from OCI is read-only.** Ctrl+S produces a downloaded
   `.db` via Save-As; the path lives in that local copy. Loading the OCI URL again gets the derived
   path — nothing writes back to the bucket. (Same shape as `staffage_instances`; not a new rule.)
2. **⛔ No UI drops a saved path.** `A.clearCinemaPath()` exists and logs `§CINEMA_PATH_CLEAR`, but
   NOTHING calls it — console only. So once a file carries `cinema_path`, every Alt+M authors from it
   until it is cleared by hand. **Named as a gap and offered to the user; not built unprompted.**
   If picked up: a "Use derived path" button in the editor next to "Save this path" is the whole job.

### One defect found while reading this path — FIXED
`A.stageCinemaPath` logged `waypoints=' + (ov.waypoints ? … : 0)` → a flat **`waypoints=0` on every
save**. Same stale-field species as §CPE_OK_CRASH (§CPE_BANDS replaced `waypoints` with `bands`), but
GUARDED, so it never threw and therefore never got noticed. Now reports `bands=3 waypoints=6` and says
outright that staging is not saving. Worth noting as a pattern: the crash was found in one afternoon
because it threw; its silent twin sat in the same feature untouched. **When a field is renamed, grep
every consumer — the guarded ones are the ones that survive to lie later.**

---

# 2026-07-27 (evening) — three items from the user's second live Hospital run

**RESUME HERE.** Two defects + one agreed-for-later design, all three raised by the user after a full
edit→OK→bake on Hospital. §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE is the lead for both defects and is ALREADY
MEASURED in the user's own pasted console — read it first.

## §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE — the baked film is NOT the film the user authored ⚠ MEASURED, NOT FIXED

The user's report for item 1 is *"It has a frame jump"*. Before touching curvature, look at this,
because it is bigger than a corner: **the plan built when the editor closes differs from the plan the
user was editing against — in the pivot, the dive and the spin.** Straight from their console, same
session, minutes apart:

| | while editing (every live re-plan) | after OK, the plan that BAKES |
|---|---|---|
| `§CINEMA_PIVOT src` | `arc-bbox-centre` pivot=(-7.3,-2.8,18.0) | **`controls-target(plausible)`** pivot=(0.0,0.0,-0.0) |
| `§CINEMA_DIVE` | `diveDist=14.2m` yaw0=-163.2° pitch0=4.2° | **`diveDist=77.2m`** yaw0=90.2° pitch0=-48.1° |
| `§CINEMA_SPIN` | `dYawRawDeg=11.4 class=already-facing(no-spin) finalSpinDeg=0.0` | **`dYawRawDeg=118.1 direct-turn finalSpinDeg=118.1`** |
| `§CINEMA_EXIT facingDot` | `0.980` | **`-0.471`** |
| `§CINEMA_PACING` | `natural=99.1s = dive 2.5 + spin 0.8 + walk 71.2 + pullback 16.7 + orbit 8.0` | `natural=99.9s = dive 3.9 + **spin 2.6** + walk 71.2 + pullback 14.3 + orbit 8.0` |

**The user previewed a film with no spin at all and got one that turns 118° at the start.** This is
not a subtle regression — it is the first two beats of every edited film. It reproduces in the
EARLIER Hospital run too (preview `arc-bbox-centre`/dive 25.4m/spin 45.8° → bake
`controls-target`/dive 62.8m/spin 107.8°), so it is not a one-off.

**Lead, to be confirmed not assumed:** `finish()` restores the camera to `_state.camSave` and calls
`a.controls.update()` before resolving. The pivot picker then sees a DIFFERENT `controls.target` than
the one in force during editing and switches source from `arc-bbox-centre` to
`controls-target(plausible)` — pivot (0,0,-0) is suspiciously the origin, i.e. a target that was never
re-aimed. Everything downstream (dive distance, `facingDot`, the spin) is derived from the pivot, so
one wrong branch moves all of them together, exactly as the table shows.

**Verify like this, numerically:** capture `A.controls.target` + `A.camera.position` at editor OPEN,
at every live re-plan, and immediately before the post-OK `cinemaPathPlan` call; log them as one
`§CPE_PIVOT_TRACE` line. If the target at bake ≠ the target during editing, that is the defect and
the fix is to plan the bake against the SAME pivot input the editor previewed — not to re-derive it.
**Gate: `§CINEMA_PIVOT src` and `diveDist` must be identical in the last editing re-plan and in the
post-OK plan.** Until that is true, no amount of corner smoothing will make the film match the preview.

### ✅ FIXED AND WITNESSED 2026-07-27 — `witness_cpe_preview_divergence.js` 3/3 Duplex + 3/3 Terminal

**The witness found it is BROADER than the pivot branch.** On Duplex the pivot `src` stayed the same
in both plans and the film still diverged:
```
RED (origin/main), Duplex — camera dollied 93.3m -> 23.3m from target mid-edit
  FAIL P1  editor: pivot=controls-target @0,0,0  dive=21.7m   spin=0.0deg
           bake:   pivot=controls-target @0,0,0  dive=91.3m   spin=0.0deg     <- 4.2x
  PASS P3  untouched camera: editor and bake agree exactly (91.3m both)
```
`diveDist` is measured from the LIVE camera to the settle point, so **any** camera movement while the
editor is open rewrites the film's opening beat — the pivot-branch flip the user hit on Hospital is
one extra symptom stacked on top, not the whole defect. P3 passing RED is the proof of mechanism:
leave the camera alone and the two agree to the metre.

**Fix:** an explicit `_camBasis` on the plan wrapper. Every editor re-plan is pinned to the camera
pose captured at editor OPEN — which is the pose the bake plans from, because `finish()` restores
exactly that before resolving. Same "set inputs, call the untouched `_cinemaPathPlan`, restore in
`finally`" pattern the beat-second overrides already use; the 600-line plan function is not touched.
The basis rides a COPY of the override, never the override itself — `_buildOverride()` is also what
"Save this path" stages, and pinning a STORED path to one session's camera would be this same bug
inverted. New log line: `§CPE_CAM_BASIS`.

```
GREEN  Duplex    editor dive=91.3m spin=0.0deg  ==  bake dive=91.3m spin=0.0deg   (dollied 93.3->23.3m)
       Terminal  editor dive=143.7m spin=57.9deg == bake dive=143.7m spin=57.9deg (dollied 119.9->30.0m)
       P2 3 re-plans across a large camera move -> 1 distinct pivot on both buildings
       P3 no-move regression clean on both
```
**Second property, free and arguably the bigger one:** looking at the path from another angle can no
longer change the path. §CPE_SCREEN_PLANE *tells* the user to orbit before dragging, so the previous
behaviour meant the documented gesture silently rewrote the film.

## §CPE_EVEN_TURN — item 1 proper: no sharp turns, no camera discontinuity

User: *"if the pipe is facing another way and then ensuing path is a sharp turn, it has to be even
curved out to never have any sharp sudden turns. And the ensuing frames connected do not jump the
camera pos/pov that breaks continuity."*

Two separate obligations, gate them separately:
1. **Position C1** — the flown curve must not kink at a band join. `§CPE_BANDS` B3 already gates
   tangent continuity, so the mechanism exists; what the user hit is the connector being *allowed
   too little room to turn*. Their log: `§CINEMA_BANDS ... maxBow=2.13m **unmeasuredJoins=2/2**` —
   BOTH connectors fell back to the conservative no-hit cap (`nudgeCap=3`) because the fan measured
   nothing, so a hard direction change had to be crammed into a bounded bow. **That is the knob**:
   when clearance is genuinely unknown, a conservative bow is the safe choice for a WALL and the
   wrong choice for a TURN. Decide what an unmeasured join should do — measured clearance stays
   authoritative wherever the fan does return a hit.
2. **Gaze C1** — the per-frame camera turn rate. The existing number to beat is the ungated
   **D2 walk-out corner whip: 19.8°/frame**, and `witness_cinema_bands.js` B5 caps the seeded layout
   at 12°/frame (adversarial layout measured 12.1). The user's edited layout is closer to adversarial
   than to seeded, which is consistent with a visible jump.
**Gate:** peak deg/frame AND peak metres/frame across the WHOLE film (not just the walk) on a
user-shaped edited path, with the §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE fix in place — a 118° phantom spin would
otherwise dominate any number this gate produces. Report both peaks and where in `u` they fall.

### 🔬 MEASURED 2026-07-27 — `witness_cpe_even_turn.js`. TWO HYPOTHESES TRIED, BOTH DISPROVEN

**Instrument committed, fix NOT — nothing shipped from this pass.** The witness is the value here: it
turned "sharp jerk" into numbers, and those numbers killed the two obvious fixes before either
reached a PR. Current measured baseline on `origin/main`, hostile 3-band layout (bands aimed apart):
```
Duplex    T2 peak = 29.1 deg/frame at u=0.281   (839deg total / 360 frames, mean 2.3)
Terminal  T2 peak = 70.2 deg/frame at u=0.370   (879deg total / 360 frames, mean 2.4)
          seeded (non-hostile) layouts: 7.6 and 7.8 deg/frame — comfortably under the 12 cap
```

**Hypothesis 1 — "the no-hit bow cap crams the corner." DISPROVEN, the cap never binds.**
Built it (probe the join along its own bow direction with `A.cinemaLookDist` instead of falling back
to the 3m sentinel cap — deliberately NOT re-reading `CINEMA_FAN_FAR` as space, per §CPE_LIVE), then
measured what was actually binding:
```
Duplex    bow 0.26m / 0.29m  against MEASURED clearance 0.86m / 0.87m
Terminal  bow 0.74m / 0.67m  against the 3m cap, and the bow ray ALSO returns 60.00 (no hit)
```
**Every bow is far under its own budget.** `k` never shrinks, so the cap is not in play on either
building. The corner is sharp because the connector SPAN is short relative to the direction change,
not because the bow was crammed. Reverted rather than shipped: unexercised code behind a vacuous gate
is exactly what §CPE_LIVE's lesson warns about.

**Hypothesis 2 — "average the gaze look-ahead across its window." DISPROVEN, made it WORSE.**
`ah = _outPos(e3 + 0.15)` is one point at the window's far edge; replacing it with the mean of 5
samples across the window measured **29.1 → 37.0 deg/frame on Duplex**. Reason, and it is general:
on a path that DOUBLES BACK the window straddles the fold, so the mean lands near the fold itself —
close to the camera — and a short look vector has an unstable direction. **A positional low-pass is
the wrong instrument for a reversing path.** Do not retry this.

### ➡ WHERE THIS GOES: fold §CPE_EVEN_TURN INTO §CPE_PACE_LOS — they are one problem
`deg/frame = (deg/metre) × (metres/frame)`. The geometry term is the user's own authored layout and
is theirs to choose; the only other lever is **metres per frame**. So "never have any sharp sudden
turns" is delivered by *spending more frames where the direction changes fast* — which is the user's
own rule (*"if too much is happening, slow down"*) with **turn rate as one of the busyness terms**,
alongside the fan hit-fraction. One mechanism satisfies both items; building them separately would
be two systems fighting over the same frames.
**Revised gate for the combined work:** T2 (peak deg/frame under cap on a hostile layout) must go
green *because* the pace slowed there — reported together with the m/frame at that same `u`, so the
gate shows the mechanism and not just the outcome.

## §CPE_PACE_LOS — item 2: even speed inside, brake only for what is actually ahead

User: *"too slow and thus gives uneven speed. It has to maintain same speed inside building and apply
brake when too near or facing an object not to crash into or zoom past but slows down just abit not
overdoing."*

**Measured:** `CINEMA_WALK_MPS = 1.3` (`effects.js:3319`) is a flat constant with no proximity term
at all. Their edited walk was **92.5 m ⇒ 71.2 s of the 99.5 s film (72%)** at that fixed pace, and
1492 frames — at the ~4.6 s/frame their §MAXQ_FRAME reported, ≈1.9 hours of cook. The runaway bake
they saw is a straight consequence of the pace, not a separate bug.

**The brake the user is describing ALREADY EXISTS — do not invent a second one.** `tour.js:1111-1165`
carries §INTERIOR_PACING / §INTERIOR_PACING_LOS, settled with this same user on 2026-07-25/26:
- `_invPace(d, ref, min)` — *"the simple inverse formula"*, far ⇒ fast, near ⇒ slow;
- `_losPace(pts, i)` — a SINGLE forward raycast along the leg via the already-exposed
  `A.cinemaLookDist`, `REF=3m` reads as neutral — chosen precisely because an omnidirectional fan-min
  braked for furniture off to the side (the courtyard bug);
- **`PACE_SWING = 1.6`, ONE knob**, symmetric: `MIN=1/1.6`, `MAX=1.6`. This is literally the user's
  *"slows down just abit not overdoing"*, already tuned with them across three live-review rounds;
- `_paceBuildRemap` redistributes time along the path AND rescales the total via `meanFactor`.
It is wired to Fly Tour's flyPath/moveTo/orbit and **not** to the cinema walk-out.

**The work:** raise the cinema base pace (1.3 m/s is a literal pedestrian and the user has now twice
called the result too slow), then apply the EXISTING remap to the walk beat. Two constants, one
reused module — not a new pacing system.
### ⚠ AMENDMENT (user, same evening) — the signal is SCENE BUSYNESS, not just distance ahead
> *"The simple rule is scene busy or noise.. if too much is happening, slow down"*

**This supersedes a pure-LOS reading of the section above.** LOS distance answers *"am I about to hit
something"*; it does NOT answer *"is there a lot going on in this shot"*. A camera crossing a wide but
densely furnished plant room is not close to anything and still deserves to slow down, because there
is something to look at. Distance-ahead alone would fly it.

**Do NOT resolve this by bringing back the omnidirectional fan-MIN.** That was tried and retired for
cause (§INTERIOR_PACING_LOS, 2026-07-26 — a courtyard traversal read slow because a low wall or a
piece of staffage off to the side tripped the min). The user's rule is a **DENSITY/COUNT**, not a
MIN, and the two fail differently: a min brakes for one nearby thing; a density does not fire in an
empty courtyard at all. Record this distinction — it is the reason this is not a re-litigation.

**Deterministic candidates only** (PRIME RULE: the same building must produce the same film on any
machine):
- **fan hit FRACTION** — `A.cinemaFan` already casts 32 rays and is the project's blessed
  clearance source. `hits within R / 32` is a density, costs nothing extra, and is already computed
  at each sample. Strongest candidate.
- **elements in the view frustum** at the sample pose (count of instances/GUIDs) — the most literal
  reading of "how much is happening", deterministic from the DB, but needs a real cost measurement
  before it goes in a per-sample loop.
- **⛔ NOT frame time / FPS / DLOD flip counts.** They measure the MACHINE, not the scene: pacing off
  them makes the same building bake a different film on a different GPU. Tempting because
  `§FPS_MODE`/`§DLOD_TICK` are right there in the log — and wrong for exactly the reason the prime
  rule exists.

**Combine, don't replace:** forward LOS keeps its job (never crash into or zoom past what is directly
ahead); busyness is the second term for "a lot is happening here". Both feed ONE `PACE_SWING`-style
knob so re-tuning stays a single number, per the user's standing *"every edit, it is just a single
number change"*.
**Gate this too:** report per-sample busyness alongside speed, and show that the slow samples are the
busy ones — the number, not the impression.

**Gate:** on an edited path, (a) speed in open interior is CONSTANT within the ±`PACE_SWING` band —
report min/mean/max m/s, not a "feels right"; (b) the slow samples coincide with genuinely low
`cinemaLookDist`, i.e. the brake fires for what is AHEAD, not for anything nearby; (c) the resulting
frame count for the user's Hospital edit lands in minutes, not hours — report it.

## §CPE_IDB_PATH_STORE — agreed, spec-only, NOT NOW (user, 2026-07-27)

User: *"on save it goes to DB.. ok fair for now.. later should be its own in IndexDB first separate
table of saved waypoints if u agree with the idea spec it first for later once we cleared this big
pathing achievement."*

**Agreed, and for a reason the current design already exposes** — see §CPE_SAVED_PATH_LIFECYCLE:
today a saved path can only live inside the building `.db`, so (a) a building served read-only from
OCI can never keep one without the user downloading a private copy, (b) one file holds exactly ONE
path, (c) saving a path means rewriting a 260 MB binary. An IndexedDB store fixes all three, and it
is the same shape the viewer already uses for `bim_ootb_logs` and `bim_ootb_cinema_maxq`.

Sketch, to be settled with the user when it comes up — **do not build from this**:
- store `bim_ootb_cinema_paths`, key `buildingId + name`, value = the band override + `_total` +
  beat seconds (the exact `_buildOverride()` object, IFC-space like `cinema_path` already is);
- MANY named paths per building ⇒ the editor grows a small list: Save as… / Load / Delete;
- the `cinema_path` TABLE STAYS as the portable/exchange format — IndexedDB is the working store,
  Ctrl+S remains how a path travels with the file to someone else. Read order at plan time:
  staged override → IndexedDB (if a path is selected) → `cinema_path` table → derived;
- this also gives `A.clearCinemaPath()` a home in the UI, which §CPE_SAVED_PATH_LIFECYCLE flags as
  missing today.
**Open question for the user when this starts:** should a path selected from IndexedDB auto-apply on
load, or only when picked from the list? (Today the DB table auto-applies, silently.)

### ⚠ AMENDMENT to §CPE_PACE_LOS (user, 2026-07-27) — graceful, not just bounded
> *"but do tamper measure not to have extreme change in speed.. graceful. If busy slows down, when not,
> picks up.. user wont get bored."*

Two separate constraints, and the existing `PACE_SWING` clamp only delivers the first:
1. **RANGE** — how slow/fast pace may get. `PACE_SWING=1.6` already bounds this.
2. **RATE** — how FAST pace may change from one sample to the next. **Nothing bounds this today.** A
   path that steps from wide-open to tight in one sample would jump between the two clamp ends
   instantly — inside the allowed range, and still a lurch. The user's "graceful" is this second one.
**Therefore:** rate-limit the pace-factor series along the path (a per-metre cap on Δfactor, or a
smoothing pass over the factors before `_paceBuildRemap` consumes them) — bounded acceleration, not
just bounded speed. And the "picks up" half is load-bearing too: the brake must RELEASE in open
space, not ratchet down and stay there, or the film ends up uniformly slow — which is the complaint
that started this.
**Gate:** report peak |Δspeed| per second AND per metre across the whole film, not just min/mean/max
speed. A film can sit inside the speed band the whole way and still lurch; only the derivative shows it.

### ⚠ AMENDMENT 2 to §CPE_PACE_LOS (user, 2026-07-27) — the total field stays the global speed knob
> *"remember there is also the overall speed control ie the total time of movie length in the panel
> can be set to a faster when reduced, or otherwise"*

Already built (`_state.userTotal`, `§CPE_TOTAL`, uniform `scale` in `_buildOverride`) and it must
survive the pacing work intact. **The interaction is the trap:** `tour.js`'s `_paceBuildRemap` does
TWO things — it redistributes time along the path AND rescales the action's own total via
`meanFactor`. The second one would silently fight an explicitly-keyed total: the user types 40s, the
remap decides the path is open and hands back 31s. So:
- **User has keyed a total → the brake REDISTRIBUTES within it only. `meanFactor` rescaling is OFF.**
  Their number is the film's length, full stop.
- **User has not keyed one → the derived total stands, and `meanFactor` may inform it** (that is the
  §CPE_PACING "length is a consequence of the building" model, which the user already ratified).
**Gate:** with a keyed total of T, the baked film's duration is T ± one frame, no matter how busy or
open the path is — while the WITHIN-film speed still varies. Both halves in one gate, or the brake
can quietly eat the user's setting and still look right.

**Three knobs, one film — keep them straight, they are not interchangeable:**
| knob | scope | owner |
|---|---|---|
| total seconds (panel field) | the WHOLE clip, uniform | the user, explicitly |
| busyness/noise temperament | WITHIN the clip, per sample | derived from the scene |
| `PACE_SWING` + the new rate limit | how far and how fast the second may move | one tuning constant each |

**Attribution — record it, it is the user's design, not a port of Fly Tour's brake:** user, 2026-07-27,
*"looking forward to that overall noise speed temperament which is my novel idea for a cinematic
experience"*. `tour.js`'s §INTERIOR_PACING_LOS is the nearest existing MECHANISM and is reused for
that reason, but it is a distance brake for navigation. What is being built here is different in
kind: pace as a function of how much the scene has to SAY at each moment — busy frame lingers, empty
frame moves on. Keep the framing (and the credit) in any doc or release note that describes it.

### 🔴 THIRD HYPOTHESIS ALSO FAILED — unified pace remap built, measured NO effect on the peak

Built the combined mechanism the user asked for (jerk + speed as one): a time↔distance remap over the
walk, three busyness terms combined by **MAX not product** (turn deg/m, fan hit-FRACTION, forward LOS),
clamped to `PACE_SWING=1.6`, rate-limited per metre, wired into Beat 3 so `e3` becomes
`_pace.u(smoothstep(...))` — position AND look-ahead both read the remapped distance. Base pace raised
`1.3 → 2.3 m/s` (arithmetic: their ~15s expectation against the 26.1s derived ⇒ ~1.8×).

**Measured on Duplex, hostile layout: 29.1 → 29.4 → 29.4 deg/frame. No effect whatsoever.**
The rate limiter was found and fixed mid-pass (a symmetric clamp toward the neighbour FLATTENED the
1m corner peak back to ~1; changed to a MAX-dilation that preserves peaks and ramps neighbours up) —
and the number still did not move. **Reverted: an unproven mechanism must not ship.**

**Beat boundaries measured, so the peak is located, not guessed:**
`dive=0.094 spin=0.124 out=0.510 rise=0.700` — the peak at `u=0.279` is squarely INSIDE the walk
(beat 3), which is the beat the remap rewrites. So the remap reaches the right beat and still changes
nothing.

**⛔ RUN THIS DIAGNOSTIC FIRST, before writing any more code.** Three plausible fixes have now been
built and killed by measurement; the fourth must start from data, not from a theory:
1. Log the `_pace` factor SERIES (not just min/mean/max) against distance, and read it at the sample
   nearest `u=0.279`. **If the factor there is ~1.0, the busyness terms are not firing on this
   layout** — most likely because the hostile path sits outside the building, so fan and LOS both
   read nothing and only the turn term is live. That would make the whole result an artefact of the
   SYNTHETIC test layout, not of the mechanism — and the real check becomes a user-shaped edit.
2. If the factor IS at the 1.6 cap there, then a 1.6× slowdown genuinely cannot fix a 29°/frame
   corner, and the honest conclusion is that `PACE_SWING` (the user's own "don't overdo it, have a
   speed range") BOUNDS how much pacing can smooth a hostile corner. Report that trade-off to the
   user rather than quietly widening their range.
3. Only then decide. Do NOT retry: the bow-ray probe (cap never binds), or the positional look-ahead
   average (measured worse, 29.1→37.0).

**Ready to apply once the above is answered, independently useful and NOT shipped:**
`CINEMA_WALK_MPS 1.3 → 2.3` alone shortens every film ~1.8× and takes the user's 1015-frame /
~26-minute Hospital cook to roughly 570 frames. Held back only because they asked for the jerk and
the speed to land together.

## §CPE_DRAG_TELEPORT — the mid-band drag teleports and cannot be dragged back (user, 2026-07-27)

> *"the drag of the waypoint seems to misbehave went off to a spot user didnt put. Draging it back,
> still flew back."*

**Root cause, and `c0` proves the intent.** `h.move` for `zone='mid'` assigned the projected cursor
point ABSOLUTELY — `b.c.x = p.x; b.c.y = p.y; b.c.z = p.z` — so the band's new centre became wherever
the grab ray met the view plane, **not** the old centre plus the gesture. `_state.drag.c0` (the
centre at pointerdown) was captured on the line above and **never read anywhere in the file** — the
delta form was clearly intended and never wired.

Two consequences, both exactly what the user described:
1. Any depth error in the grab point `p0` becomes an immediate **teleport** — the band lands where
   the ray happens to cross, not under the cursor.
2. The next drag re-anchors its plane at the already-wrong depth, so **"dragging it back" moves it
   wrong again**. The error compounds instead of cancelling.

**Measured in their own log:**
```
§CPE_DRAG band=1 zone=mid centre=(-14.26, 39.24,-33.54)   floorY=-15.47, settle y=-13.8
§CPE_DRAG band=1 zone=mid centre=(-15.04, 41.65,-25.45)   ← the "drag it back" attempt, still up there
pathLen 32.3m -> 40.3 -> 52.0 -> 161.7m       walk 24.9s -> 124.4s      k=[0.55,0.55] -> [0.09,0.55]
```
y=+39 against a floor at −15.5 is **~55m above the floor** — the band was flung into the sky, and the
5× path length is why their film ballooned to 148s.

**Fix (one line, shipped):** `b.c = c0 + (p - p0)`. A zero-pixel drag is now a zero-metre move by
construction, and any `p0` depth error cancels out of the difference instead of accumulating.
End-drags (`_rotateAbout`) are absolute by nature — rotate the band to aim at the cursor — and are
correct as they stand; only the mid/translate branch was wrong.

**⚠ NOT YET WITNESSED — this is the one thing outstanding on it.** The gate to write:
- **G-DRAG-1** zero-pixel drag ⇒ centre unchanged to 1e-9 (the invariant the absolute form breaks).
- **G-DRAG-2** a known pixel delta ⇒ centre moves by exactly the corresponding world delta in the
  view plane, and by **zero along the view normal** (the band must not change depth at all).
- **G-DRAG-3** drag out and back to the same pixel ⇒ centre returns to its start within 1e-6. This is
  literally the user's "dragging it back" and is the gate that would have caught this.

# ⛔ SESSION END 2026-07-27 (LATER) — §CPE_JERK_SETTLED — READ THIS FIRST

**Both of the user's headline asks are now BUILT, MEASURED and PUSHED.** The earlier session-end
block below is kept for its dead-end record only; its status table is STALE and must not be quoted.

## The user's asks, answered against numbers
| their words | state |
|---|---|
| "1. NO JERK" | **DONE.** Hostile-layout peak 29.1 → **6.7** deg/frame (Duplex), 46.8 → **7.3** (Terminal), cap 12. `witness_cpe_even_turn.js` **PASS 3/3 both**. |
| "2. EVEN SPEED NOISE" | **DONE** — and it is the *same* mechanism, not a second feature. See the formula below. |
| "that jerk was happening at the 2nd wp1 after the settle" | **ROOT-CAUSED THERE EXACTLY.** It was an 81° DISCONTINUITY at the Beat2→Beat3 seam. Now 0.18°. |
| "out of control drag" | **DONE.** `witness_cpe_drag.js` **4/4 both** (PR #1038 branch). |

`witness_cinema_path_editor.js` **9/9 both**. Branches pushed, both green, neither merged yet:
- `fix/cpe-drag-reach-revert` @ `96f9f66` — drag 4/4. (PR #1038, needs merge.)
- `feat/cpe-even-turn` — jerk + seam, merged up to `origin/main` already, witnesses green.

## §CPE_JERK_DEFINITION — what a jerk IS (settled, user 2026-07-27)
User's own definition, verbatim: *"pov sudden position, turn angle too large, need even out between
frames."* Operationally, THREE measurable things — a fix must not trade one for another:
1. **Gaze sweep per frame** — the angle between consecutive frames' gaze DIRECTION vectors (3D).
2. **Position step per frame** — metres between consecutive frames' camera positions.
3. **Discontinuities** — detected by re-sampling the same neighbourhood at **100× density**: a real
   turn shrinks ~100×, a genuine STEP stays the same size. This test is what found the 81° seam and
   it is the single most useful diagnostic in this lane. Reuse it.

**Do NOT measure yaw.** Yaw is degenerate near-vertical: on Terminal it read 46.8 deg/frame where
the gaze sat at 87.2° pitch (horizontal component 0.049) and the TRUE sweep was 7.2. The old T2 gated
yaw and was chasing an instrument artefact.

**Where the camera POINTS is the USER'S creative control** (their explicit ruling, 2026-07-27:
*"Gaze angle is user control, why u wana fix? Fix only jerks, speed etc."* / *"user creativity .. leave
to them its intuition"*). We own only how fast it may CHANGE. Do not "fix" a camera aim, a chosen
exit, or a path's steepness because it looks odd — that ruling also killed a line of investigation
into Terminal's 83.4° first walk leg, which is CORRECT AS DESIGNED (dive into a big space → exit →
orbit is the intended film).

## §CPE_EVEN_TURN — the elegant formula (THIS IS THE SETTLED ANSWER, do not re-derive)
**The mistake every earlier attempt made:** keep frames evenly spaced in TIME/DISTANCE, then try to
fix a corner by MULTIPLYING speed there. Bounded by `PACE_SWING`, a multiplier can divide a peak by
at most 1.6, against a measured 29.1 deg/frame needing 2.4×. **H3 moving 29.1 → 29.4 was an
arithmetic ceiling, not bad tuning.** No amount of pacing work can beat that ceiling.

**The fix — make pace the PARAMETERIZATION, not a correction.** Step frames at equal increments of a
blended cost:

    dc = (1-w)·(ds/S)  +  w·(dθ/Θ)

with `S` the walk's arc length, `Θ` its total gaze turn. If every frame advanced the same `Δc = 1/N`,
each term would be bounded on its own, by construction:

    Δθ ≤ Θ / (w·N)          — turn per frame, at most 1/w × the perfectly-even Θ/N
    Δs ≤ S / ((1-w)·N)      — distance per frame, at most 1/(1-w) × nominal speed

### ⚠ CORRECTION (review, 2026-07-27) — Δc is NOT constant, and the delivered range is 2.4×, not 1.6×
The paragraph above described the mechanism in isolation. **The shipped code composes the remap with
the ease** — `_evenTurnRemap(_cinemaSmoothstep(t))` (`effects.js`, Beat 3) — and `_cinemaSmoothstep`
is `t²(3-2t)`, whose derivative **peaks at 1.5** at the midpoint. Frames are uniform in TIME, so cost
advances at up to `1.5/N` per frame and **every bound above carries a ×1.5**:

    Δθ ≤ 1.5·Θ / (w·N)      Δs ≤ 1.5·S / ((1-w)·N)

**So `1/(1-w)` is the per-cost-step range, NOT the speed range the film delivers.** Delivered range is
`1.5/(1-w) ≈ 2.4×`: against `CINEMA_WALK_MPS = 2.3` the walk peaks near **5.5 m/s**, and §CPE_WALK's
"2.3 m/s pace" is a **MEAN**, not the pace — read any gate asserting 2.30 as asserting the average.

The ease is deliberate and should stay (zero rate at both beat seams, so the walk neither starts nor
stops abruptly); the ×1.5 is its price. What is **not** settled is whether 2.4× is inside what the user
meant by *"don't overdo it"* — the gaze half passes comfortably (7.3 measured against the 12 cap), but
the POSITION half of §CPE_JERK_DEFINITION is still ungated, so nothing measures the metres-per-frame
this bound governs. **Gating the position step is what turns this from an argument into a measurement**
— it is already the top known gap, and this correction is the reason it matters more than it looked.

`w` itself is still **not tuned**: the single dial was chosen by the user, and the turn bound falls
out of it. Slow-in-the-turn and pick-up-in-the-open are not imposed by a brake — they are what equal
cost stepping DOES, and the brake releases in open space for free because there is no dθ to pay for.
This is simultaneously ask 1 (no jerk) and ask 2 (even speed noise): one mechanism, both asks.

Implementation: `viewer/effects.js`, `_evenTurnBuild()` + `_evenTurnRemap()`, applied to Beat 3's
progress. The cost table samples `_beat3Pose()` — the REAL poses — never a re-implementation of the
gaze rule, so the table and the film cannot drift apart. Guard: `Θ < 1e-3` falls back to pure arc
length (today's behaviour) so a straight walk is untouched.

## §CINEMA_LOOKAHEAD_ARC — the jerk the user kept reporting. FOUND, FIXED, WITNESSED (2026-07-27)
**The user was right and the code was wrong.** After §CPE_EVEN_TURN and §CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS shipped,
Hospital still jerked. Gated at last (see §CPE_POSITION_GATE below) it measured **81.0 deg/frame at
u=0.312, INSIDE the walk**, and the 100× density test returned **ratio 1.0× — a true STEP**.

**Cause.** Beat 3's look-ahead had a collapse guard: *if the point at `u+0.15` is within 0.5 m,
substitute `(odx, 0, odz) × 20`.* That substitute is a DIFFERENT vector, switched to in one frame.
The measured gaze went `(-0.230, 0.973, -0.019)` → `(-0.733, 0.000, 0.680)`. **The `y` of exactly
0.000 is the substitution's fingerprint** — that is how to recognise this class of bug again.

**What did NOT work, and why it is the lesson:** searching forward for the first point that clears
the 0.5 m radius. It only shrank the step (81.0 → **21.3**, still ratio 1.4× = still a step), because
on a folding path the first-clearing point can itself jump. **Any rule of the form "if the look-ahead
is too close, use something else" contains a switch, and a switch is a step.** Window size was never
the variable; the THRESHOLD was.

**The fix — remove the threshold entirely.** The look-ahead is the point a fixed **ARC LENGTH**
further along the path (`L = 0.15 × walkLen`, the same 0.15 the fraction window meant, now in metres).
Arc length is monotone in `u`, so that point always exists and always moves continuously, on **any**
path shape. Nothing to collapse, nothing to substitute. The `(odx,odz)` fallback survives for exactly
one case — a walk of zero length, where there is no path to read a direction from, and where Beat 4
opens on `(odx,0,odz)` anyway.

| | Hospital peak | 100× ratio | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 81.0 deg/frame | 1.0× | STEP |
| forward-search (rejected) | 21.3 | 1.4× | still a STEP |
| **arc-length (shipped)** | **11.2** | **92.9×** | **fast turn, under the 12 cap** |

`_lookAhead()` in `viewer/effects.js` is now the ONE look-ahead rule — Beat 3 and the
§CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS opening direction both call it, so they cannot drift apart.

**Witnessed:** `witness_cpe_even_turn` **4/4 on Duplex, Terminal AND Hospital** (Hospital added this
session — it had never been gated, which is why this survived three sessions of "fixed" claims).
No regression: `witness_cinema_path_editor` 9/9, `witness_cpe_undo` 6/6, `witness_cpe_ok_bake` 3/3.

## §CPE_POSITION_GATE — T5, the ungated half of §CPE_JERK_DEFINITION (2026-07-27)
The user's definition names *"pov sudden position"* FIRST; every gate until now measured only the
gaze sweep. A camera can hold a perfectly steady aim while teleporting.

**T5 in `witness_cpe_even_turn.js`.** Cap is DERIVED per beat, never picked: each beat is a smoothstep
of its own time fraction and smoothstep's derivative peaks at exactly 1.5, so a smooth traverse cannot
exceed **1.5× that beat's own mean step**. Two stated exceptions:
- **the walk gets 1.5 × PACE_SWING = 2.4×** — it is deliberately cost-parameterized (§CPE_EVEN_TURN),
  so holding it to 1.5× would gate the FEATURE, not a defect;
- **the spin is exempt by name** — an in-place turn, whose motion T2 already owns. Exempted by name
  rather than a magnitude threshold, because a threshold would just be a number chosen to straddle
  the three buildings (measured means: Duplex 0.01 m, Terminal 0.02 m, Hospital 0.03 m per frame).

**Measured walk ratios: Duplex 2.4×, Terminal 2.3×, Hospital 2.4× against the 2.4× allowance** — the
corrected derivation below, confirmed empirically rather than argued. **No teleport on any building.**

⚠ **Hospital's 17.22 m/frame at u=0.914 is the ORBIT at 1.4× its own mean** — 360° in 8 s at a 91 m
radius. Smooth by construction, NOT a step; it was briefly mis-called a bug this session. It is
genuinely fast (~189 m/s) and may be what reads as "too fast" on large buildings, but that is an
orbit-duration design constant and a separate decision. Do not re-diagnose it as a jerk.

## §CPE_PACE_FLOOR — the 2-second pause. Built, MEASURED, and it collides with T2. ⛔ USER DECISION
**User, live on Hospital, 2026-07-27:** *"eventually it moves but it must be 2 secs pausing there in
movie later"*. A STALL, the exact opposite of the jerk §CPE_EVEN_TURN was built for.

**Cause, and it is our own bound being half-written.** `PACE_SWING` is a RANGE, but only its fast
half was ever enforced: `Δs ≤ 1.5·S/((1-w)·N)` caps how FAST the walk gets, and NOTHING capped how
slow. Where `dθ` dominates a cost step, `ds → 0` and the camera crawls. Hospital's walk turns
**488° over 36 m**, so one corner can eat the whole budget. Measured with no floor:
**min = 0.000 m/frame, 596× slower than the beat mean — a dead stop.**

**Instrument note worth keeping.** A flat floor CANNOT measure this: every beat is a smoothstep of
its own time fraction, so its first and last frames legitimately approach zero speed (that ease is
what makes the seams smooth), and a flat floor duly reported a "stall" at `u=0.524` — which IS
`beats.out`, the walk's own end. T6 therefore compares each frame against what the ease alone
predicts there, `expected(e) = mean × 6e(1-e)`, and gates `measured/expected ≥ 1/PACE_SWING`.

**The fix built (parked, not merged):** clamp the cost slope against normalised arc so cost cannot
accumulate faster than `PACE_SWING × uniform`. Clamp-then-renormalise does NOT work — rescaling by
the shrunk span multiplies every slope by `1/span > 1` and puts back exactly what the clamp removed
(measured 53–57% against a 63% floor). The removed cost must be redistributed to the segments not at
the cap: water-filling, bisect `k` such that `Σ min(k·raw_i, SWING·dArc_i) = 1`. Feasible because
`Σ SWING·dArc = 1.6 > 1`.

**⛔ WHY IT IS PARKED — the dial cannot satisfy both gates at once.** With the floor in:

| | T6 stall (floor 63%) | T2 jerk (cap 12°/frame) |
|---|---|---|
| no floor | 0% — dead stop | Duplex 10.6 / Terminal 6.9 / Hospital 11.2 ✅ |
| water-filled floor | 60–62% — still short | **Duplex and Hospital go RED** |

Slowing less in the corner necessarily turns more per frame. **`PACE_SWING = 1.6` is not wide enough
to hold both the 12°/frame jerk cap and a no-stall floor on these layouts.** This is precisely the
trade-off the earlier spec said to take back rather than resolve by widening a user's number to make
a gate green. The question: **widen `PACE_SWING`, accept the stall, or accept more jerk?** Everything
is built and measured; only the choice is missing.

## ▶ FOUR ASKS CAPTURED 2026-07-27, NOT YET BUILT (user, live, mid-session — do not lose these)
1. **"the sudden jump of the wp to a high position on top of building still happening"** — the
   §CPE_DRAG_SCALE item below, confirmed still live by the user AFTER §CINEMA_LOOKAHEAD_ARC shipped.
   Measured at 0.453 m/px on Hospital; blocked only on the 1:1-vs-precision-modifier decision.
2. **"when orbiting outside the cam remains pointed to the building in the centre.. since our wp
   before follows the path"** — user observation about the orbit beat's gaze. Recorded verbatim;
   NOT yet analysed, and it is not obvious whether they are reporting it as correct-and-good or as
   a defect. Ask before building.
3. **"the stick band should curve along more.. now it is short, if twisted its curve still short..
   having more make it more useful to craft"** — bands are too short to author with; a twisted band
   should produce a longer curve. Relates to §CPE_SCREEN_PLANE's known cosmetic gap (bands drawn as
   thin lines, ~1–1.3 m, three grab spheres). Likely the same fix: longer bands rendered as tubes
   with a nearest-third hit-test.
4. **"why cant we have sense of time/timer.. measure in the code"** — DONE for the bake readout as
   §MAXQ_ETA_TICK (PR #1046): status every frame, console throttled on elapsed ms not frame index.
   The principle generalises and the user stated it as a general one.
5. **"after edit and OK, it should do the 10 sec fast preview again, so user sees the impact before
   final decision"** — OK currently commits straight to the bake. It should re-run the existing 10s
   fast preview on the EDITED path first, so the edit is seen before the ~25-minute cook is
   committed to. The preview loop already exists (`cinema_maxq.js`, the 10s authored path preview
   noted in §CINEMA_DAMPING_BLEED), so this is a wiring job, not a new mechanism. Sequence the user
   described: edit → OK → 10s preview → then decide. Buildable as specified; no open question.

## §CPE_DRAG_SCALE — "wp1 jumps to way high" MEASURED. ⛔ ONE USER DECISION, then it is buildable
**User, 2026-07-27, live on Hospital:** *"it still has another bug where the wp1 jumps to way high"*,
with `§CPE_DRAG band=1 zone=mid plane=view centre=(2.88,-16.72,-26.43)` against `floorY=-15.47` —
the waypoint 1.25 m below the floor.

**This is NOT a delta bug.** §CPE_DRAG_TELEPORT is fixed and `G-DRAG-4` measures the mapping at
0.9973× / 0.9991× — the handle tracks the cursor correctly. It is not a plane bug either:
§CPE_SCREEN_PLANE settled that a drag moves the handle in the camera's view plane and that height
comes from a side view, and the user accepted that cost explicitly.

**What was never settled is the SCALE.** The view plane sits at the handle's distance from the
camera, so world-metres-per-pixel grows with that distance. Measured (`probe_drag_scale.js`, fov 60,
700 px viewport, from the real opening camera):

| building | handle dist | m/px | a 50 px flick moves | walk length |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Duplex | 91 m | 0.151 | **7.5 m** | 12.6 m |
| Terminal | 138 m | 0.227 | **11.4 m** | 25.3 m |
| Hospital | 274 m | **0.453** | **22.7 m** | 29.8 m |

**On Hospital a 50-pixel nudge throws a waypoint 76% of the entire walk.** That is the mechanism
behind "jumps to way high", and it is worst exactly where the user hit it. 1:1 with the cursor is
correct *on screen* and far too coarse *in the world*.

⛔ **BLOCKED — the one question, because the answer contradicts a settled model either way:**
should a drag stay pinned 1:1 under the cursor (§CPE_SCREEN_PLANE's "the dot when touched can only
move in that XY sense"), meaning the fix is *zoom in first* and this is workflow, not defect — or
should a precision modifier (e.g. Shift = 0.1×) break 1:1 while held? Do NOT pick one silently:
1:1-under-the-finger is the user's own stated model, so reducing it is their call, not a bug fix.

Everything needed to build either is measured and in hand; only the choice is missing.

## §CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS — the discontinuity, and why it goes in the WALK
The Beat2→Beat3 seam stepped **81° in one frame** on Terminal (at the user's reported wp1-after-
settle). Proven a STEP not a fast turn by the 100× density test: it stayed 81°. Cause: the spin ends
on a LEVEL gaze while the walk opens aimed up a 16m climb (walk-out leg 1 measured `run 1.85m,
rise 15.98m` = 83.4°).

Fix: the walk now OPENS on exactly the direction the spin handed over, and eases onto its own aim
over `_openU`, sized at the project's existing `CINEMA_TURN_DPS`. **81° → 0.18°.**

**⚠ It is closed inside the WALK, deliberately — do not "simplify" this into the spin.** That was
tried and measured: paying for it in the spin makes the spin's DURATION depend on the authored path,
which shifts every beat fraction before it and breaks G2's "an edit changes nothing before it".
`§CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS seamGapDeg=` logs the seam every plan; it must stay ~0.

## ✅ THE TWO "RED" GATES WERE BROKEN INSTRUMENTS — RESOLVED, both now PASS
**Earlier in this same session I recorded G2 and G7 as red on `origin/main` and framed G2 as a spec
tension needing a user decision. BOTH of those conclusions were WRONG and are retracted here.**
Neither gate was measuring a jerk; both were measuring themselves wrong. `witness_cinema_path_editor.js`
is now **9/9 on Duplex and 9/9 on Terminal**.

**G7** measured `planS` (the 90° dog-leg) but filtered frames with `planA.beats` — a DIFFERENT plan,
from a different path, whose walk occupies a different fraction of the film. The window was misaligned
with `planS`'s own walk, so the gate sampled beats the walk's pacing does not govern (the spin runs on
a clock, not on the path). That is precisely why G7 sat at 15.7/20.4 **to the decimal** while every
other jerk number moved: the peak it reported was never in the walk.

| window fixed | Duplex | Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| pristine `origin/main` | 4.4 | 6.9 | ← **already passing**; there was never a defect |
| this branch | 3.3 | 4.6 | ← pacing improves an already-good number |

**§CPE_EVEN_TURN did not fix G7 and must not be credited with it.**

**G2** compared the two films at the same PERCENTAGE through. The edited path is longer, and §9
("path length sets the clock") means the edited film legitimately RUNS LONGER — `cinema_maxq.js:414`
sets the real bake's frame count from `plan.naturalTotal`, so that is the product's actual behaviour,
not a theory. Sampling both at the same normalized `t` lines second 3 of a 24s film against second 4
of a 32s one, and reports the opening as "changed" when nothing about it moved. Beat seconds are
derived independently of path length (the dive from its own distance), so **at equal REAL time the
opening is identical by construction**. Compared at equal absolute seconds:
`firstDiffT=0.155 vs diveEnds=0.114` (Duplex), `0.1425 vs 0.111` (Terminal) — the edit changes things
only AFTER the dive.

**⛔ The "when an edit lengthens the path, absolute seconds or fractions?" question is WITHDRAWN.**
There is no conflict with §9 and no user decision is needed. Do not ask it.

**The lesson, worth more than either gate:** two instrument bugs in a row, both of which would have
been read as product defects. `feedback_verify_checker_before_code_under_test` earned its place —
when a number refuses to move while everything around it moves, suspect the meter, not the engine.

## §CPE_UNDO — Ctrl+Z on the editor, reflected in the history line ✅ BUILT & WITNESSED
**User, 2026-07-27:** *"also put in the prompts/# to allow UNDO, Ctl-Z as reflecting in the history
line to take effect so a misplaced can be easily reverted?"*

**Why it is not a nicety:** direct manipulation is only safe to experiment with if a bad drag costs
nothing to reverse. Dragging a band back BY HAND is exactly the gesture §CPE_DRAG_TELEPORT measured
as unreliable (a 12.6m residue on the return drag). Undo makes the reversal exact — measured
residue **0.00e+0 m**.

### The one design call, and why (do NOT "improve" this into the model op-log)
A waypoint edit is **TRANSIENT editor state** until the user explicitly saves the path
(§CPE_BUILT persistence). It therefore has **no signed kernel op to flip**. So §CPE_UNDO is a LOCAL
snapshot stack, *not* `KernelOps` / `UniversalHistory.undo()`:
- routing it through the model op-log would **mint fake model ops** for edits that may never be
  saved, and
- Ctrl+Z would then undo *the wrong thing* once the editor closed.

The history **line** still shows it, via `UniversalHistory.recordEvent('CINEMA_PATH_EDIT', label)` —
the existing **read-only detail-event** channel (`universal_history.js`, `HISTORY_SESSION_EVENTS.md`
A1). That satisfies the user's ask exactly ("reflecting in the history line") without faking a model
change. **If a future session is tempted to unify these, this paragraph is the reason not to.**

### Rules
1. Snapshot **BEFORE** every mutation, never after — that is what makes the restore exact.
2. Cover **BOTH** input routes: canvas drags AND keyed panel edits. §CINEMA_PATH_EDITOR_MODEL item
   19 makes panel and canvas the same state, so an undo covering only one is a trap.
3. A new edit **clears the redo stack** (standard linear undo; the same rule UniversalHistory
   applies to a new op after a step-back).
4. The keydown listener is added on open and **removed on close** — it must never shadow any other
   Ctrl+Z (notably `grid_drag.js`, which owns the same binding when grid drag is active).
5. Depth cap `_UNDO_MAX = 50`.
6. Bindings: `Ctrl+Z` undo, `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` redo. Capture phase + `preventDefault`, so the
   browser's own text-undo does not fight it while a number input has focus.

### Witness — `witness_cpe_undo.js`, **6/6 Duplex, 6/6 Terminal**
Driven by a **REAL keystroke** through the browser's input pipeline, not an exposed seam, so it
proves the binding a user actually presses (per `feedback_test_real_user_path_not_seams`).

| gate | measured |
|---|---|
| U1 drag then Ctrl+Z restores exactly | dragged 14.26m / 22.18m → residue **0.00e+0 m** |
| U2 Ctrl+Shift+Z redoes | 0.00e+0 m from the dragged position |
| U3 empty stack is a safe no-op | 0 m drift, 0 page errors |
| U4 reaches the history line | 3 `CINEMA_PATH_EDIT` events observed on the channel |
| U5 keyed panel edit undoes too | 0.00e+0 m residue |
| U6 a press that never MOVES leaves no phantom undo entry | found by review; snapshot moved to first real movement |

No regression: `witness_cinema_path_editor` 9/9 both, `witness_cpe_ok_bake` 3/3 both.
Shipped as `CPE_V v8`, `cinema_path_editor.js?v=9`, `sw CACHE_VERSION v863`.

### Known follow-on, NOT built
Undo currently covers **band geometry** (centre, direction, length). It does **not** cover the
total-seconds field or the orbit stop-row elasticity. Neither is a "misplaced drag", which is what
the user asked for, so this is a deliberate scope line rather than an oversight — but if either later
becomes draggable, extend `_undoPush` to snapshot it in the same call.

## §CPE_REVIEW_PACK — for a reviewing session (Sonnet). READ BEFORE OPENING THE DIFF
Everything below is what a reviewer needs that the diff alone does not tell you: how each mechanism
works, and where I think it is weak. Nothing here is aspirational — every number is measured and the
log line that produced it is named.

### ⚠ SCRUTINISE THIS HARDEST: I changed two failing gates and they went green
This is the single highest-risk thing in the change set and it deserves the reviewer's first hour.
`witness_cinema_path_editor.js` G2 and G7 were RED; I edited both gates and both now PASS.
**Verify I corrected the instruments rather than lowered the bar.** The specific claims to re-check:
- **G7** — I changed which plan's beat boundaries define the sample window (`planA.beats` →
  `planS.beats`). Claim: it was measuring `planS` through `planA`'s window. **Falsifiable check:**
  run the fixed witness against pristine `origin/main` `effects.js` — I measured it **already
  passing at 4.4 (Duplex) / 6.9 (Terminal)**. If main passes with the fixed window, the old 15.7/20.4
  was never a real defect. If it does NOT reproduce, my fix is wrong and G7 must go back to red.
- **G2** — I changed the comparison from equal NORMALIZED time to equal ABSOLUTE SECONDS. Claim:
  §9 makes the edited film legitimately longer, so equal-percentage compares different moments.
  **Load-bearing evidence:** `cinema_maxq.js:414` sets the real bake's frame count from
  `plan.naturalTotal`. If that line does not do what I say, my justification collapses and the
  change is a gate weakening. Check that line first.
- **T1 in `witness_cpe_even_turn.js`** — I DEMOTED it from a gate to an INFO line. It gated the
  bow-ray rescue hypothesis. Judge whether retiring it is honest or convenient.

### The change set, mechanism by mechanism
**1. `§CPE_EVEN_TURN` — `viewer/effects.js`**
- `_evenTurnBuild()` (~L4576) samples `_beat3Pose(e)` at 241 points, accumulating arc length `s` and
  3D gaze turn `θ`, then builds a normalised cost table `_etC[i] = (1-w)(s_i/S) + w(θ_i/Θ)`.
- `_evenTurnRemap(u)` (~L4606) is its monotone inverse: binary search + linear interpolation.
- Beat 3 calls `_beat3Pose(_evenTurnRemap(smoothstep(t)))` instead of `_beat3Pose(smoothstep(t))`.
- `w = 1 - 1/CINEMA_PACE_SWING` = 0.375 (`_etW`, ~L4574). **`w` is not tunable by feel** — see the
  §CPE_EVEN_TURN formula section above for why 1/(1-w) IS the speed range.
- **Why the table samples `_beat3Pose` and not a re-derivation of the gaze rule:** if the table and
  the flown film computed the aim by two different code paths they would drift apart silently. This
  is deliberate; do not "optimise" it into a cheaper approximation of the gaze.
- Guard: `Θ < 1e-3` ⇒ `w = 0`, i.e. pure arc length = today's behaviour on a straight walk.

**2. `§CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS` — `viewer/effects.js`**
- `_openDir` (~L4230) = the direction the walk wants to open on, from `_outPos(0)`→`_outPos(0.15)`
  with the same 0.5m collapse guard Beat 3 itself uses.
- `_handDir` / `_openDeg` / `_openU` (~L4257) = the direction the spin hands over (level, on the
  spin's final bearing), the gap between them, and how much of the walk the handoff needs at
  `CINEMA_TURN_DPS`.
- In `_beat3Pose` the gaze is smoothstep-blended from `_handDir` onto the walk's own aim across
  `_openU`, so `e3=0` looks EXACTLY where the spin left off.
- `§CPE_SEAM_CONTINUOUS seamGapDeg=` is logged every plan and must stay ~0.
- **The trap:** closing this in the SPIN instead is the obvious-looking simplification and it is
  wrong — it makes the spin's duration path-dependent, which shifts every earlier beat fraction and
  breaks G2. I tried it, measured it, reverted it. Do not re-suggest it.

**3. `§CPE_UNDO` — `viewer/cinema_path_editor.js`**
- `_undoPush(label)` L369, `_histEvent` L376, `_undoApply` L383, `_undo`/`_redo` L399.
- Snapshot points: first real drag movement (`h.move`, guarded by `drag.snapped`), keyed centre
  edit L429, keyed length edit L447. Keydown handler `h.key` L688, removed in `_unwire`.
- Local snapshot stack, NOT the model op-log — reasoning in §CPE_UNDO above; that reasoning is the
  part to review, the code is small.

### Measured, with the source of each number
| claim | measured | where |
|---|---|---|
| jerk, hostile layout | Duplex 29.1 → 6.7, Terminal 46.8 → 7.3 deg/frame (cap 12) | `witness_cpe_even_turn.js` T2 |
| jerk, realistic layout | 4.5–7.8 deg/frame | same, INFO line |
| seam discontinuity | 81° → 0.18° at 100× sampling density | `diag` + `seamGapDeg` |
| undo exactness | 0.00e+0 m residue | `witness_cpe_undo.js` U1 |
| drag 1:1 | 0.9973× / 0.9991×, direction 0.01°/0.00° | `witness_cpe_drag.js` G-DRAG-4 |
| plan cost (Alt+C budget) | Duplex 16.5 vs main 15.5 ms; Terminal 77.0 vs main 86.6 ms | `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS` |

Green: `witness_cpe_even_turn` 3/3, `witness_cpe_undo` 6/6, `witness_cpe_drag` 4/4,
`witness_cinema_path_editor` 9/9, `witness_cpe_ok_bake` 3/3 — all on BOTH Duplex and Terminal.

### Issues I know about and did NOT fix — verify I have not understated these
1. **The position half of the jerk is UNGATED.** The user's definition names "sudden position"
   FIRST, and T2 gates only the gaze sweep. `_evenTurnRemap` bounds `Δs` mathematically, but nothing
   asserts it. **This is the biggest real gap.** Add per-frame metres to `turnPeak()`.
2. **Pacing covers the WALK only.** Dive, spin, turn-and-rise and orbit run on a clock, not on the
   path, so `§CPE_EVEN_TURN` cannot touch a jerk that lives in them. Unknown whether one does.
3. **The opening blend uses normalised LERP, not SLERP.** Fine for the angles seen (it stays
   monotone and continuous) but it is not a constant angular rate through the blend. If a future
   layout produces a large `_openDeg`, revisit.
4. **`_openU` clamps at 1.** A very short walk with a large handoff angle means the blend spans the
   ENTIRE walk. Not observed; no gate covers it.
5. **Undo does not cover the total-seconds field or the orbit stop-row elasticity** — only band
   geometry. Deliberate scope line (neither is a "misplaced drag"), but state it, do not discover it.
6. **`_UNDO_MAX = 50` is an invented constant.** Small, bounded, harmless — but it is invented, and
   this project's prime rule says to name such things rather than let them pass as derived.
7. **G6 baseline is still red on main** (`witness_cinema_exit_breathe`, `_flat_ending`,
   `_reciprocal`, `_glazing`, and `_damping_bleed` crashes). Pre-existing, untouched, NOT caused by
   this work — see §CPE_BUILT G6. Do not attribute them here.

### How to run everything
`python3 -m http.server 8403 --bind 127.0.0.1` (buildings are symlinked from
`~/bim-ootb/buildings/`), then `PORT=8403 node witness_<name>.js`. The drag witness lives in
`/tmp/wt-drag` on port 8402. **Both worktrees already exist and are clean — reuse them, do not
create new ones** (worktree hygiene, CLAUDE.md).

## ▶ NEXT SESSION — executable, in order
1. **Merge PR #1038** (`fix/cpe-drag-reach-revert`, 4/4 green) and open+merge a PR for
   `feat/cpe-even-turn`. Both are pushed and green; nothing to re-run first.
2. **§CPE_UNDO — Ctrl+Z on the editor, landing in the history line.** Spec below. This is the
   user's live ask (2026-07-27) and the top item.
3. **Gate the position half of the jerk definition.** T2 gates gaze SWEEP only. Add the per-frame
   POSITION step (metres) to `turnPeak()` in `witness_cpe_even_turn.js` and gate it — the user's own
   definition names "sudden position" FIRST and it is currently ungated. Only known real gap in the
   jerk lane.
4. **Do NOT add the pitch term to `_spinDeg`** — tried this session; it makes the spin's duration
   path-dependent and shifts every earlier beat fraction. Reverted; must stay reverted.
5. Nothing else outstanding. Both previously-"red" gates were instrument bugs (above), and there is
   no pending user question.

## Rig
`python3 -m http.server 8403 --bind 127.0.0.1` (buildings are symlinked from
`~/bim-ootb/buildings/`), then `PORT=8403 node witness_cpe_even_turn.js`. Drag witness runs on
`/tmp/wt-drag` port 8402. Both worktrees exist and are clean — **reuse them, do not create new ones**
(worktree hygiene rule in CLAUDE.md).

# ⛔ SESSION END 2026-07-27 (EARLIER) — SUPERSEDED BY §CPE_JERK_SETTLED BELOW

**The user's three asks are NOT done. Two of three have nothing shipped. Do not report progress on
them without re-measuring.** Everything below is measured, not remembered.

## Answer the user's own three questions, honestly, before anything else
| their question | answer |
|---|---|
| "is the jerk solved?" | **NO.** Nothing shipped. THREE hypotheses built and all three disproven by measurement. |
| "is the out of control drag solved?" | **PARTLY.** Teleport-on-touch is fixed and gated. **Out-and-back still FAILS (G-DRAG-3).** |
| "is the even noise speed ratio applied?" | **NO.** Only the flat base pace shipped. The temperament — their own idea — is not in the product. |

## ⚠ FIRST ACTION, before writing any code
**PR #1038 is open and unmerged: it removes the §CPE_DRAG_REACH cap and adds `witness_cpe_drag.js`.**
The cap is ON MAIN (merged in #1037) and is **known harmful** — `G-DRAG-3` measured it breaking the
user's exact "drag it back" case. Merge #1038, then **run `witness_cpe_drag.js` immediately** — it was
NOT re-run after the removal. Expected: G-DRAG-3 flips to PASS. If it does not, the residue has a
second cause and the cap was never the whole story.

Run it with the standing rig: `cd <worktree> && python3 -m http.server 8402` (symlink
`buildings/{Duplex,Terminal}_extracted.db` from `~/bim-ootb/buildings/`), then `node witness_cpe_drag.js`.

## What actually shipped today (all merged, all witnessed unless noted)
| PR | what | gates |
|---|---|---|
| #1029 | §CPE_OK_CRASH — OK after an edit no longer kills the bake | 3/3 + 3/3 |
| #1030 | §CPE_PANEL_DRAG — panel drags by its header | 4/4 + 4/4 |
| #1031 | §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE — the film you edit is the film that bakes | 3/3 + 3/3 |
| #1032 | `witness_cpe_even_turn.js` — turn-rate instrument, no production change | T2 RED by design |
| #1035 | §CPE_DRAG_TELEPORT — drag is a DELTA, not the cursor point | ⚠ ungated when merged |
| #1036 | `CPE_V` fingerprint so `§CPE_LOADED` identifies the build | — |
| #1037 | §CPE_WALK 2.3 m/s base pace **+ the harmful reach cap** | pace verified 2.30 both |
| #1038 | **OPEN** — removes the cap, adds `witness_cpe_drag.js` | G-DRAG-3 not re-run |

## The three dead ends — DO NOT RETRY THESE
1. **Bow cap** (§CPE_EVEN_TURN H1). The cap never binds: Duplex bows 0.26/0.29m against MEASURED
   0.86/0.87m clearance; Terminal 0.74/0.67m against a 3m cap. `k` never shrinks.
2. **Gaze look-ahead window mean** (H2). MEASURED WORSE: 29.1 → 37.0 deg/frame. On a path that
   doubles back the window straddles the fold, the mean lands near the fold, and a short look vector
   has an unstable direction.
3. **Pace remap over the walk** (H3). 29.1 → 29.4, i.e. nothing — even after fixing a real bug in its
   rate limiter mid-pass (a symmetric clamp toward the neighbour FLATTENED the 1m corner peak; a
   MAX-dilation that preserves peaks and ramps neighbours up is the correct form and is what to
   re-use). Beat boundaries were measured (`dive=0.094 spin=0.124 out=0.510 rise=0.700`) so the
   peak at `u=0.279` IS inside the walk — the remap reaches the right beat and changes nothing.

## ⛔ THE DIAGNOSTIC THAT MUST RUN BEFORE HYPOTHESIS 4
Log the pace FACTOR SERIES (not min/mean/max) against distance and read it at `u=0.279`:
- **~1.0 there** ⇒ the busyness terms are not firing on the synthetic hostile layout (its path likely
  sits outside the building, so fan and LOS both read nothing and only the turn term is live). Then
  the whole 29 deg/frame result is a TEST ARTEFACT and the real check is a user-shaped edit.
- **at the 1.6 cap** ⇒ a 1.6× slowdown genuinely cannot fix a 29 deg/frame corner, and `PACE_SWING` —
  the user's own *"don't overdo it, have a speed range"* — bounds what pacing can do. **Take that
  trade-off back to the user; do not widen their range to make a gate green.**

## The user's settled direction for the temperament (all recorded above, do not re-ask)
- *"if too much is happening, slow down"* — a DENSITY (fan hit-fraction), never the fan MIN that was
  retired for the courtyard bug.
- *"graceful"* — bound the RATE of change, not just the range. Use the MAX-dilation form.
- *"have a speed range… don't overdo"* — `PACE_SWING = 1.6`.
- *"picks up… user wont get bored"* — the brake must RELEASE in open space, not ratchet down.
- *"the cam pos/pov must not shift without interim frames"* — turn rate is a busyness TERM;
  `deg/frame = (deg/metre) × (metres/frame)` and metres-per-frame is the only lever we own.
- Total-seconds field = a pure uniform compress/elongate of the finished film. A keyed total must
  never be rescaled by `meanFactor`.
- **Attribution:** the noise-temperament model is the USER'S design idea, not a port of Fly Tour's
  distance brake. Keep the credit in any doc or release note.

## Also still open
- `A.clearCinemaPath()` has no UI — once a file carries a `cinema_path`, every Alt+M authors from it.
- §CPE_IDB_PATH_STORE — specced, parked at the user's request.
- `witness_cinema_exit_breathe` / `_flat_ending` / `_reciprocal` / `_glazing` were ALREADY RED on
  main before this session (see §CPE_BUILT G6). Not caused by this work.

# ▶ HANDOVER 2026-07-27 (late) — read this first in a new session

## The one lesson this session actually taught
**Four separate "defects" in this lane were broken instruments, not broken code** (G7, G2, then
`witness_cpe_even_turn` T2 and `witness_cinema_bands` B5). The last two both sampled `dur * fps` — a
fixed 24s film — while the product bakes `plan.naturalTotal` seconds (`cinema_maxq.js:414`), and
§CPE_TURN_BUDGET now makes that grow with route turn. **The film is no longer 24s.** `deg/FRAME`
falls with frame count, so every jerk number argued over for two sessions was measured at a duration
no user ever sees. Fixing the instrument alone moved Hospital 21.6 → 5.6 and Duplex 20.4 → 5.2.

**Before believing any gate in this lane, check what duration it samples.** When a number refuses to
move while everything around it moves, suspect the meter — `feedback_verify_checker_before_code_under_test`
has now earned its place four times here.

## Shipped and green (PR #1047 + #1042/#1044/#1046)
`witness_cpe_even_turn` **5/5 on Duplex, Terminal AND Hospital**; `witness_cinema_bands` 6/6;
`witness_cinema_path_editor` 9/9; `witness_cpe_undo` 6/6; `witness_cpe_ok_bake` 3/3.

## 🔴 LIVE BUG, user-reported 2026-07-27, NOT reproduced in a witness yet — take this first
**"UNDO did not revert the jump in wpts when dragged too far."** §CPE_UNDO is live and correct on
its own gates (`witness_cpe_undo` 6/6, U1 residue 0.00e+0 m, driven by a REAL keystroke), so the
gates are passing while the user's actual gesture fails — which means the witness does not reproduce
the gesture. **Build the repro first; do not "fix" undo against gates that already pass.**

ALREADY RULED OUT by reading the code — do not re-walk these:
- `_replanFilm()` does NOT reseed `_state.bands`. It only recomputes `filmPts`/`plan` from
  `_buildOverride()`, which READS `_state.bands`. A restore is not being overwritten by the replan.
- The snapshot is taken BEFORE mutation on the first real move (`h.move`, `drag.snapped` guard), so
  a huge first-move jump is still captured pre-jump.
- `h.key` is registered on `window` in capture phase with `preventDefault`, removed in `_unwire`.

STILL SUSPECT, in order:
1. **Two drags, one Ctrl+Z.** If the user jumps, then drags BACK to correct, that is TWO undo
   entries — one Ctrl+Z reverts only the correction and looks like "undo did nothing". Cheapest to
   check, and if it is this the fix is UX (coalesce a gesture pair, or surface undo depth), not the
   stack.
2. **The jump may not be band geometry at all.** Undo covers centre/direction/length only
   (deliberate scope line, §CPE_UNDO "Known follow-on"). If dragging too far also moves something
   outside that set, undo cannot restore it BY DESIGN and the scope line is the bug.
3. `_scheduleReplan`'s debounce firing across the undo — believed harmless (it reads restored
   bands) but not proven.

Reproduce with a drag of the SCALE the user actually hits: §CPE_DRAG_SCALE measured 0.453 m/px on
Hospital, so a 50px flick moves a waypoint 22.7m. `witness_cpe_undo` U1 drags 14-22m on
Duplex/Terminal — a much milder gesture than the failing one.

## ⛔ NEXT, in order — every one is specified, none is guesswork
1. **The spin-at-wp1 (user, live, 2026-07-27: "at wp1 it can spin around itself one full rev").**
   **⚖ USER RULING, same day, settled — do NOT re-litigate:** *"no reason to if it follows its path,
   even at wp1, no reason not to follow."* A full revolution is therefore a DEFECT, never a stylistic
   choice and never something to detect-and-permit. **The gaze follows the path. Full stop.** Any fix
   that "smooths" a revolution rather than removing it is wrong by this ruling.
   Likely causes to check FIRST, in this order, before touching anything: (a) the arc-length
   `_lookAhead` can point BACKWARDS where the route folds, since arc length keeps advancing through a
   fold — the look-ahead point is then behind the camera and the gaze swings through 180°+;
   (b) `_cinemaGazeBlend` taking the long way round a wrap boundary. Both are cheap to instrument.
   **NOT NOTICED BY ANY GATE, and T2 structurally cannot see it** — it measures deg per FRAME, and a
   360° revolution spread smoothly over many frames passes. Hospital accumulates 888° of gaze sweep
   across the film (~2.5 revolutions) with T2 green. **The instrument to build: NET vs ACCUMULATED
   gaze rotation over a short stretch of path.** Accumulated ≈360° with net ≈0° IS a spin-in-place.
   Build the gate FIRST, then look for the cause — that ordering is what worked every time this
   session and guessing first is what wasted it.
2. **§CPE_LOOK_HOME keyed to the WALL CROSSING.** User narrowed it themselves: *"the only concern is
   when leaving building outer wall — cam turns towards centre of building, or face perpendicular to
   path towards building centre."* Do NOT implement it by widening `CINEMA_TURN_OVERLAP`: that was
   tried at 0.75 and reverted — it starts the blend while still inside, broke G10 (Terminal wp1
   aimErr 36.5° vs 25 cap), and was the sole cause of Duplex's 15.5 deg/frame. `exitOuter` is
   already computed in the plan; key off that crossing.
3. **The 10s preview after OK** (§ ask 5) — must fly the EDITED plan through the SAME `poseAt` the
   bake uses, or it re-creates §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE.
4. **§CPE_DRAG_SCALE** — still open, still one user decision (1:1 vs a precision modifier).
5. **Screen dims / brightness flash at the jerk spot** (user, live). Suspect the photoreal staging
   re-firing on camera movement (`§STILL_REFINE` / `§PHOTO_AO` / `§NIGHT_MODE` cycle constantly in
   their logs), NOT the camera — T5 already proves there is no position teleport.

## Dead ends — do NOT retry, all measured
- **Noise-speed as a SPEED heuristic** (`v = clamp(avgNoise/noise, 1/SWING, SWING)`), per-segment
  AND windowed. Both measured WORSE on jerk (11.2 → 16.5 → 18.3) because a speed law has no bound on
  turn-per-frame, and windowing removes the slowdown exactly at the corner needing it. The blended
  cost `dc = (1-w)ds/S + w·dθ/Θ` is kept because `Δθ ≤ Θ/(w·N)` is PROVABLE. The user's instinct that
  one abstract structure covers it was right — the missing half was FRAMES (§CPE_TURN_BUDGET), since
  with N fixed the mean is Θ/N no matter how you redistribute.
- **Clamp-then-renormalise** for the pace floor: rescaling by the shrunk span multiplies every slope
  by `1/span > 1` and restores exactly what the clamp removed. Use the water-filling bisection.
- **Pitch term in `_spinDeg`** — makes the spin's duration path-dependent, breaks G2.

# ▶ SESSION 2026-07-27 (latest) — §CPE_NOISE_LAW: the noise ratio now governs the DIVE, and the ease no longer governs the film

## Retracted: the "LIVE BUG — undo does not revert a far drag" above is NOT A BUG
**User, 2026-07-27: "UNDO does work, i was pressing the wrong key.."** The 🔴 LIVE BUG block in the
previous handover is closed with no code change. Nothing was altered in `cinema_path_editor.js`.
Do not re-open it, do not build the far-drag repro that block asks for.

## The user's method, examined as asked ("examine the noise ratio method from me, if it is not well written")
It is a good method and it was written badly — three specific faults, all now fixed here:
1. **It was scattered** across §CPE_PACE_LOS + two amendments, §CPE_EVEN_TURN + a correction,
   §CPE_TURN_BUDGET and §CPE_PACE_FLOOR. No single place stated the law, so each session rebuilt
   its own reading of it.
2. **Every sentence was phrased about THE WALK.** Nothing said it governs the whole film — which is
   exactly why the dive never got it. The user's correction: *"it governs thrughout"*.
3. **"Noise" meant two different things** in two sections (gaze turn per metre vs scene busyness)
   and only the first was ever built. So *"still not using noise ratio"* was literally true.

## ⚖ THE LAW, as the user settled it this session — do NOT re-derive, do NOT re-litigate
- *"it governs thrughout"* — every beat, not the walk alone.
- *"isnt it best to use the bbxes to smell out the frame rate"* — the signal is **bbox**, not the ray
  fan. (Proved necessary: see the blind-fan finding below.)
- *"20% density, 80% noise ie rate of change"* → final: **"i would say its 100% rate of change of
  bbxes"**. Density is NOT the signal.
- *"because if frame not changing, not matter how dense the animation is not moving makes a boring
  show"* — the reason. A dense but static frame is a still; lingering on it is the boredom.
- *"when outside building it changes as the building is far off, or it hits the max ... We are in a
  range, thus no worry"* — **no outside/inside special case, no panorama branch.** The swing bounds
  both failure modes. Do not add a clamp.
- *"thus it is not using the noise ratio"* (on seeing the stalls) — the diagnosis was correct and is
  now measured: the per-beat smoothstep spanned **20x** while the law modulated only 1.1–1.5x.

## Built (`viewer/effects.js`, branch `fix/cpe-noise-law-dive` off `origin/main` @ fa6d251)
1. **`_densityAt(p)`** — count of `element_transforms` bbox centres within `CINEMA_FAN_FAR` of the
   point, counted in IFC space (one point converted, never the 48k rows). DB truth, deterministic,
   no new constant.
2. **The dive's cost table** — noise = normalised |central difference of that count| along 64
   uniform points of the dive line; cost per metre = `1 + (SWING-1)·noise`; frames stepped at equal
   cost via `_diveRemap` (same monotone-inverse shape as `_evenTurnRemap`).
3. **The dive's SECONDS bought by the same number** — `_diveEff/CINEMA_DIVE_MPS × (1+(SWING-1)·meanNoise)`,
   the §CPE_TURN_BUDGET half generalised to Beat 1.
4. **`_cinemaEaseFloored`** — `a·t + (1-a)·smoothstep(t)`, `a = 1/PACE_SWING`. Applied to the dive,
   the walk and the rise. Ends still 0→0 and 1→1, so no beat boundary and no path moves, but the
   rate at every seam is now `1/1.6` of the beat mean instead of ZERO.
5. `CINEMA_PACE_SWING` hoisted to module scope — one dial, read by every beat.

## Measured — `witness_cpe_noise_law.js`, **4/4 Duplex, 4/4 Terminal** (N5 below is the exception)
| gate | Duplex | Terminal |
|---|---|---|
| N1 slower where the bbox neighbourhood changes fastest | 1.17x slower | 1.44–1.68x slower |
| N2 residual after the ease inside [1/1.6, 1.6] | 0.68–1.04x | 0.72–1.16x |
| N3 pacing changed, path did not (dive still lands on settle) | 5.8e-15 m | 3.6e-15 m |
| N4 plan budget | 62 ms (was 80) | 226–295 ms (was 204) |
| **raw dive speed spread, before → after the floored ease** | **20x → 1.82x** | **25x → 1.64x** |
| N5 dive stall | **0.00 s** | **0.00 s** |

## 🔴 STILL OPEN, measured this session, NOT fixed — take these first
1. **Terminal's WALK stalls 2.27 s** (34 frames under beat-mean/1.6, at u=0.195). N5 catches it; the
   floored ease fixed the dive and the rise but not this. It is the parked §CPE_PACE_FLOOR
   trade-off, now with a live user report behind it ("last wpt stalling as the first one") and a
   number. The walk's `_paceFloor` bounds the COST slope against uniform arc, not the DELIVERED
   speed — that is the gap to close.
2. **Outside the envelope the gaze spins AWAY from the building** (user, live, 2026-07-27). Relates
   to §CPE_LOOK_HOME (next-list item 2) and to the earlier orbit-gaze observation. Not analysed.
3. **`witness_cpe_gaze_spin.js` (new, S1/S2)** — net-vs-accumulated gaze, the instrument T2
   structurally cannot provide. **PASSES on Duplex, Terminal AND Hospital on the DEFAULT plan**, so
   the reported "full rev at wp1" does not reproduce without an edited path. Worst waste: 15.2 deg
   (Duplex walk), 6.5 deg (Hospital orbit). Run it against an EDITED path next.

## ⚠ THE BLIND FAN — a rig finding that invalidates other measurements, not just this one
On Terminal in the headless rig `_cinemaFanMeshes()` returns **ZERO meshes**. Every `_cinemaFan`
call then reports the `CINEMA_FAN_FAR` sentinel, every `§CINEMA_SPACE` candidate reads
`enclosed=0%`, and the settle **falls back to bbox-centre at y=-31.5 (below ground)**. Any
fan-derived number measured on Terminal in this rig is meaningless. `§CPE_NOISE_LAW` logs
`elems=` for exactly this reason, and the law uses bboxes so it keeps working (Terminal:
`elems=48428`, noise 0.21→0.77→0.72→0.34 across the descent, where the fan saw nothing).

## Instrument corrections made this session — verify these rather than trust them
Three gates were wrong before they were right, each for a stated reason:
- N1 first measured density change **between consecutive FRAMES** — large wherever the camera moves
  fast, so it measured the pacing it was judging and read *inverted* (0.67x "faster where busier").
  Now sampled on uniform PATH position, as the law does.
- N1/N2 then compared **raw metres per frame**, which is dominated by the ease (the noise peak sits
  mid-dive, exactly where smoothstep peaks at 1.5). Now both divide the ease out.
- N2's expected model was **stale by one build** — still `6e(1-e)` after the beat moved to the
  floored ease, reading 0.55x. Now `a + (1-a)·6e(1-e)`.
This is the fifth, sixth and seventh broken instrument in this lane. `feedback_verify_checker_before_code_under_test`.

## Not a defect — the per-frame staging cycle in the bake log
`§PHOTO_STAGING on/off`, `§STILL_REFINE start/cancelled`, `§PHOTO_AO start/done/off` cycling once
per `§MAXQ_FRAME` is MaxQ's DESIGN: `cinema_maxq.js` calls `startStillRefine()` and waits for the
fold on every frame, so each frame is a converged photoreal still. It costs ~1.5–2 s of the
~2.3 s/frame and it is the reason a 914-frame Hospital bake runs ~35–45 min. Frames are captured
after `§PHOTO_AO done`, so the output is consistent; the flashing is the live viewport only. Do not
"fix" it without deciding to trade quality for time.

## ⚠ REGRESSION CHECK after the floored ease — `witness_cpe_even_turn`: T2 better, T5/T6 RED
Run immediately after the change, both buildings, same rig:
- **T2 (the jerk) IMPROVED**: peak gaze sweep **4.1 deg/frame** on both (was 5.2 Duplex / 6.9–7.3
  Terminal, cap 12). Flooring the ease did not cost jerk; it bought some.
- **T5 RED on Duplex, green on Terminal.** Believed a STALE MODEL, not a defect: T5 allows the walk
  `1.5 × PACE_SWING` because it is cost-parameterized and every other beat only `1.5` — but the DIVE
  is now cost-parameterized too (§CPE_NOISE_LAW), so its allowance is the same `1.5 × 1.6` the walk
  already gets. **Verify before changing it** — run T5 against `origin/main` and against this branch
  and compare which beat trips.
- **T6 RED on both.** Two causes tangled and they must be separated before either is "fixed":
  (a) its expected model is `mean × 6e(1-e)`, i.e. plain smoothstep — stale by one build now that
  the walk uses the floored ease (this is the identical correction N2 needed, where it moved the
  reading from 0.55x to 0.68x); and (b) Terminal's walk really does stall **2.27 s** (N5, above).
  Fix the model FIRST, then see how much stall is left.

## ⚖ RULING — the stalls are ACCEPTED (user, 2026-07-27). §CPE_PACE_FLOOR's parked question is answered
> *"i thnk the stalls are ok, it may mean a sec or two pause which is fine in the film"* ...
> *"but if the noise ratio tempers it a bit also ok"*

This closes the trade-off that was parked as "widen PACE_SWING, accept the stall, or accept more
jerk?" — **accept the stall.** Consequences, all applied:
- `witness_cpe_noise_law` N5 is a **REPORT with a 3 s ceiling**, not a 0.5 s gate. Gating a pause the
  user calls good film-making was gating their taste. The number still prints every run.
- **T6 must get the same treatment** (still RED, and it is now red against an accepted behaviour).
  It also still divides out plain smoothstep while the walk uses the floored ease — fix the model
  first, then demote it to a report with the ruling quoted.
- Tempering was done by FINISHING the law, not by adding a mechanism: the walk's cost increments are
  now weighted by the same bbox rate of change the dive uses, so a corner whose content is not
  changing stays cheap. Terminal's pause **2.27 s → 2.07 s**. Tempered "a bit", exactly as asked.

### The radius finding — a fixed neighbourhood makes the term INERT
A 60 m neighbourhood is constant across a 12–36 m walk: the walk's noise series measured
`maxChange=0` on BOTH buildings, i.e. the term did nothing and the crawl was untouched. The radius
is now **half the beat's own travel**, capped at the fan horizon (`_noiseRadius`): Duplex 6.3 m,
Terminal 12.7 m, and `maxChange` 0 → 157 / 219. Any future beat that adopts the law must pick its
radius the same way — this is the difference between the law running and merely being installed.

### 🔴 The one thing this widened — T5, and it is REAL, not a stale model
`T5 walk: peak 0.13m vs mean 0.04m = 3.0x against its 2.4x allowance` (Duplex, u=0.697). My earlier
guess that T5 was stale is **WRONG and is corrected here**: the dive passes at 1.2x, so the model is
fine — the walk's position spread genuinely widened, because the noise weight multiplies a cost that
was already spread by `1/(1-w)`. Worst case is `1.5 × SWING × SWING = 3.8x`, which is outside the
one dial the user set. **Next session decides: make the noise weight mean-neutral for the walk, or
state 3.8x as the walk's new bound.** Do not merge this branch into a release without that decision.
Branch: `bim-ootb` `fix/cpe-noise-law-dive` @ 5d89659 (pushed, not merged).

## 🔴 §CPE_BASIS_HALF_PIN — FOUND from the user's console, FIXED, and the gate CANNOT see it
**User, live Hospital, 2026-07-27: "Drag still jumps."** Their log settles it. Same session, same
edit — the plan while editing vs the plan at OK:

| | editing (every re-plan) | baking (at OK) |
|---|---|---|
| `yaw0 / pitch0` | −88.9° / **−16.9°** | +91.5° / **−81.0°** |
| `§CINEMA_EXIT facingDot` | +0.456 (cost 15.4) | **−0.450** (cost 16.8) |
| `§CINEMA_SPIN` | −35.3° | **504.3°, `class=behind(full-lap)`** |

A **different exit door** and **a full extra lap of spin**. The 504° also explains the earlier
"at wp1 it can spin around itself one full rev" — it is not in the default plan (which is why
`witness_cpe_gaze_spin` passes on all three buildings), it appears only in the BAKED plan after an
edit.

**Root cause:** `yaw0/pitch0` are read from `A.camera.getWorldDirection()` — the camera's
**ROTATION** — but `_withCamBasis` pinned only `camera.position` and `controls.target` and never
re-aimed. Editor re-plans therefore ran the pinned POSITION with the user's live orbited ROTATION,
while `finish()` sets position + target + `controls.update()`, which does re-aim, so the bake ran
the real basis. §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE was only half closed. **Half a pin is not a pin.**

**Fixed:** `lookAt(basis target)` + `updateMatrixWorld` inside the swap; original quaternion
restored in the `finally`.

### ⚠ THE GATE IS BLIND TO THIS — build P4 before trusting this area again
`witness_cpe_preview_divergence` is **3/3 on both buildings after the fix — and it was ALSO 3/3
before it.** It MOVES the camera between editor and bake and never ROTATES it, which is exactly the
half that was broken. **P4, the missing gate:** orbit the camera while the editor is open (rotation
only, no translation), then compare the editor's last plan against the bake's plan on `yaw0`,
`pitch0`, the chosen exit GUID and `finalSpinDeg`. It must fail on `origin/main` and pass here — if
it passes on both, this diagnosis is wrong and the numbers above need re-deriving.
This is the **eighth** broken instrument in this lane; `feedback_verify_checker_before_code_under_test`.

## "Edited preview still not there" — NOT a regression, never built
Their log goes `§CPE_CLOSE action=ok edited=true` → `§CPE_LOCKS re-claimed` → `§CPE_APPLIED
frames=1409` → `§MAXQ_FRAME i=0/1409`. No second `§MAXQ_PREVIEW`; the only one ran BEFORE the editor
opened. This is **ask 5** of the FOUR ASKS block ("after edit and OK, it should do the 10 sec fast
preview again"), still unbuilt. It is a wiring job on the existing preview loop, and it must fly the
EDITED plan through the same `poseAt` the bake uses or it re-creates §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE.

# ▶▶ START HERE — NEXT SESSION (2026-07-27, LATER session close). Everything below the next rule is
# the PREVIOUS handover, kept for its rulings; items 1, 2 and 3 of its list are now DONE.

**Merged to `main` as PR #1052 (`998750e`).** The user is flying it. `fix/cpe-drag-rationale` is a
docs-only follow-up, pushed, not yet merged.

## Done this session
| item | § | proof |
|---|---|---|
| 1 merge the branch | — | was ALREADY merged as PR #1050 before the session started. The 31-line delta vs `main` was only `§RESET_AMBIENT_AUTO`, which `main` deliberately reverted in #1048 — not missing cinema work. Do not re-check this. |
| 2 build P4 | §CPE_BASIS_HALF_PIN | `witness_cpe_preview_divergence.js` P4 ORBITS mid-edit (P1-P3 only dolly, which is exactly why they were blind). **RED on the half-pin: 3/4** — editor `yaw0=5.0 pitch0=-13.3 exit=1hOSvn6df7F8 spin=-500.6`, bake `yaw0=-135.0 pitch0=-43.3 exit=2OBrcmyk58Nu spin=0.0`. **GREEN fixed: 4/4** Duplex, Terminal, HHS_Office. The RED signature reproduces the user's live Hospital report (different exit door + a full extra lap). |
| 3 the 10s preview after OK | §CPE_PREVIEW_AFTER | `witness_cpe_preview_after.js` 4/4 Duplex + HHS_Office. G-PA-3 on HHS: the edited preview's `poseAt(0)` and the bake's first frame are **0.00m apart**. RED on the old build 1/4 (G-PA-4 correctly still passes there). One implementation, two call sites; `poseAt` resolves `plan` at call time so the second run flies the EDITED plan through the bake's own function. Edit-only, so guardrail 2 survives. |
| — the drag residual | §CPE_DRAG_TRACK | NEW, arose from the user flying the merge. See the ruling below. |

## §CPE_DRAG_TRACK — the drag question is CLOSED. Do NOT reopen it.
The user flew the merged build and reported: *"much better, as it delays the path but the wpts still
jumpy but its more intuitive to handle"*, then *"and the wypt jerk is gone.. great"*. Measured — two
stages that pull opposite ways, and measuring either alone explains neither:
- **cursor → band: 0.47x** (Duplex), 0.44x (Terminal), 0.46x (HHS). The handle lands ~103px behind a
  194px gesture. `§CPE_DRAG_SCALE`'s constant `envelope/canvasHeight` rate equals true perspective at
  exactly one depth; everywhere else cursor-lock is impossible by construction.
- **band → path: +1.98m** of path per metre of band (Duplex), +1.61m (HHS). This is the "lever".
- `§CPE_DRAG_LAND_FIRST` is provably clean: out-and-back residue **0.0000m**, and the re-plan on
  release moves the placed band **0.0000m**. That is the jerk the user says is gone.

**RULINGS (2026-07-27, shown the numbers):**
> *"I think it is fine.. the slight jump is no longer exagerated, it is in small measures so the user
> able to hold and see it coming back quicker than before... which is more of a feature as user need
> not drag further on fear of losing to big jump."*
> *"Its like a lever effect. Move small length, it exagerates bigger but not jump as the path has not
> react yet until release."*
> *"the amplification is good in sense the user need not do much dragging as it is hard over canvas
> that is overlay to get XY plane."*

So it **LOGS, it does not GATE** — the app emits `§CPE_DRAG_TRACK` on every real gesture, derived
in-app from the gesture's own pixels and the camera frustum, independent of `_dragBasis` so it can
contradict that code rather than echo it. The witness check is a drift report only (0.20-0.85x;
**1.00x means §CPE_DRAG_TELEPORT's frightening leaps are back**). Cursor-lock is NOT the goal here
and a future session must not "fix" the 0.45x.

## CLOSED, was item 4 — the dive base rate. Do NOT reopen, do NOT ask for a number.
User, 2026-07-27: *"The dive is OK as it has slowed down leave it alone."* `§CPE_NOISE_LAW` already
did the job. The previous handover's "decide it with a number, with them" was itself off-doctrine —
the noise ratio **governs throughout** (a settled ruling, see below), so there was never a constant
to ask them to pick. `CINEMA_DIVE_MPS = 20` stays as it is. Asking again is the drift this note exists
to stop.

## ⛔ §CINEMA_TAIL_DECAY — RETRACTED. The Hospital film below is CONTAMINATED DATA, not a pacing
## measurement. Do NOT act on it. Kept only because the retraction is the finding.
**User, 2026-07-27, after it was written:** *"The hospital just before was frozen tab due to been out
of focus."* That bake ran backgrounded. rAF throttled, `§MAXQ_FRAME_TIMEOUT` captured frames "as-is"
that had never converged, and consecutive captures ended up near-duplicates — which is precisely why
the measured inter-frame change collapsed toward the end. The ~30% tail is the CAPTURE dying, not the
camera slowing. Every structural conclusion drawn from it below (orbit/rise lack a noise term →
therefore the film ends dull) is unsupported by that artifact.

**The lesson, worth more than the retracted claim:** measuring the delivered artifact is only sound if
the artifact was produced under valid conditions. "It came out of the real pipeline" is not the same
as "it is valid evidence". Ask how the bake ran before drawing anything from a film.

**The re-use, which IS valuable — this makes open item 8 detectable.** A backgrounded bake now has a
fingerprint readable straight off the MP4 with no console access: the inter-frame change decays toward
zero over the final seconds while the earlier beats look normal. Any future "is this film any good"
check should run the ffmpeg command below FIRST to reject contaminated captures before analysing
pacing at all.

---

## §CINEMA_TAIL_DECAY — the original (retracted) entry, for the method only
The user pointed at their newest bake (*"Latest MP4 in downloads can be indication what speeds"*) —
`~/Downloads/BIM_MaxQ_Hospital_1785146208680.mp4`, baked 17:56 local on the MERGED build, so it is
the current law's real output, not a lab run. **45.4s, 681 frames @15fps, 1852x960.**

Measured the way the law itself defines the signal — 100% rate of change — with no eyeballing:
```
ffmpeg -v error -i FILM.mp4 -vf "scale=160:-1,format=gray,tblend=all_mode=difference,\
signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YAVG:file=yavg.txt" -f null -
```
`YAVG` per frame = mean absolute inter-frame difference (0-255 grey) = how much of the frame is
changing. Per-second means:

| beat | seconds | rate of change |
|---|---|---|
| dive | 0-3s | **25-42** — fastest in the film, peak 41.9 at 2s |
| interior walk | 8-15s | 5-9 |
| walk, later | 19-21s | ~14 |
| spike | 26s | 21.5 |
| **exterior tail** | **40-45s** | **3.4-5.3 — slowest in the film** |

`mean 11.54  min 3.34  max 41.87  spread 12.5x  p90/p10 4.58x`

**Two findings, and they point opposite ways:**
1. **No stalls anywhere** — nothing falls below 25% of the mean. The floored ease is doing its job on
   the delivered artifact, not just in the witness. `§CPE_NOISE_LAW`'s dive-stall claim holds up.
2. **The film ends on its quietest 6 seconds.** The tail decays monotonically from 13.9 at 34s to
   3.44 at 45s — ~30% of the mean, and 12x slower than the dive. The exterior orbit+rise is where
   the pacing now falls over, NOT the dive (which the user has explicitly closed).

`CINEMA_PACE_SWING = 1.6` can bend a beat by at most ±1.6x; the delivered spread is 4.58x (p90/p10).
The orbit/rise beats take their seconds from `360 / CINEMA_TURN_DPS` and `_pullDist /
CINEMA_PULLBACK_MPS`, neither of which carries a noise term — so structurally the exterior beats
never got the treatment the dive and walk got.

### ⚠ CORRECTED SAME SESSION — the long tail decay is NOT general. Do not chase it as one.
A second film, `~/Downloads/TerminalHiQ.mp4` (18:29, same merged build, WITH the edited preview,
user-confirmed working), measured the same way — **44.1s, 662 frames**:

| | Terminal 07:16 (before today) | **Terminal 18:29 (today)** | Hospital 17:56 |
|---|---|---|---|
| p90/p10 | 4.90x | **3.86x** | 4.58x |
| last-6s mean vs film mean | 94% | **81%** | ~30% |
| min second | 3.50 | **0.52** | 3.34 |

Terminal's tail holds at 81% — nothing like Hospital's ~30%. **The exterior neglect is real in the
code but only bites on some geometry**, so the Hospital reading was over-generalized when first
written above. Also note the delivered evenness IMPROVED 4.90x -> 3.86x against yesterday, on a film
twice as long (the harder case) — the user's *"much better than yesterday"* is corroborated, and this
is the number to defend in future changes.

### §CINEMA_END_FREEZE — the actual residue, small and specific
Both films end on their quietest second, and Terminal's is a near-total halt: the last seconds run
`... 15.0, 5.3, 0.52` against a mean of 12.10 — a 23x drop inside 1.5s, and a 103.7x spread across
the film driven entirely by that one second. Hospital does the same thing more gently (3.44). The
camera stops dead before the film ends. Bounded, reproducible, visible in a single number
(`min second`) the user can check.

⚠ **Hospital's 3.44 is NOT evidence for this** — that film was a backgrounded bake (see the
retraction above) and its whole tail is invalid. The claim rests on **Terminal alone**, which the user
watched and confirmed good, so its 0.52 is a real film ending on a real halt. Before building
anything here, bake one more foreground film and check whether the last-second collapse repeats. One
artifact is not a pattern — that is the mistake the retraction above records.

## The three-movie facade — why this lane is not a side feature (user framing, 2026-07-27)
> *"this 3 movie scrubbable TM, Fly, and MaxQ gives the facade signals"*
> *"Distro is no issue as the videos are progresively shown and noted by growing number beginning
>  awareness in reddit, oSARCH and Linked as Youtube"*

**TM (Time Machine), Fly (Fly Tour) and MaxQ are one family, not three features** — three scrubbable
films that together are the product's outward-facing surface. The videos ARE the distribution channel
(reddit, OSArch, LinkedIn, YouTube), and awareness is already growing off them. So a pacing defect in
MaxQ is not a polish item: it is a defect in the thing that reaches people.

Two consequences for anyone working this lane:
- **Judge the delivered film, not the code path.** The ffmpeg rate-of-change measurement above is the
  right instrument, and it applies to all three members — a TM or Fly clip can be measured the same
  way and compared against MaxQ's numbers.
- **Do not treat "it markets itself" as someone else's problem to solve later.** It is already
  working; the job is to not ship a film that undercuts it. That is exactly what a silently
  backgrounded bake does (item 8), which is why it is promoted.

## Still open — in order
5. **§CINEMA_END_FREEZE (above)** — the camera stops dead in the final ~1.5s (Terminal's last second
   reads 0.52 against a mean of 12.10). Bounded and reproducible. Gate it on the delivered MP4's
   `min second`, a number the user can check themselves. Give `orbit`/`rise` the noise term the dive
   and walk already carry — but treat §CINEMA_TAIL_DECAY as building-dependent, NOT as a general
   defect: Terminal's tail is fine at 81% of mean, only Hospital's collapsed.
6. **Outside the envelope the gaze spins away from the building** (user, live, never analysed).
   Almost certainly the same exterior-beat neglect as §CINEMA_TAIL_DECAY — do them together.
7. **T5 / T6 are RED, different answers each.** T5: the walk's position step is 3.0x against a 2.4x
   allowance — REAL (noise weight multiplying an already-spread cost, worst case 1.5·SWING²=3.8x).
   Decide: mean-neutral walk noise, or state 3.8x as the bound. T6: stale model (still plain
   smoothstep) AND it gates a stall the user has ACCEPTED — fix the model, then demote it to a
   report quoting the ruling, exactly as G-TRACK-1 was demoted above.
8. **Background-tab bake degrades QUALITY, not just speed — PROMOTED, this is the one that silently
   ruins output.** `§MAXQ_FRAME_TIMEOUT i=683 capturing as-is` is a frame that never converged, and
   the Hospital film above proves it reaches the delivered MP4: a whole backgrounded tail of
   near-duplicate frames that a viewer would read as the film stalling. The user lost a 45s Hospital
   bake to it today and only knew because they remembered the tab was unfocused. Options: drive the
   fold off timers rather than rAF, or refuse to advance while `document.hidden` and log the pause.
   **Whichever is chosen, the bake must SAY it was backgrounded** — a film that degrades silently is
   worse than one that pauses. Detector already exists (ffmpeg command above): tail change decaying
   toward zero while earlier beats look normal.
9. **`GL_INVALID_OPERATION: Feedback loop formed between Framebuffer and active Texture`** floods the
   console at load. A pass samples the texture it renders into; those draws are DROPPED by the
   driver. Undiagnosed — note it before trusting any still/AO frame timing.

## Rig notes learned the hard way this session
- `/tmp/wt-turn` on port 8403, buildings symlinked. **Reuse it.** `PORT=8403 node witness_<name>.js`.
- **puppeteer's default `protocolTimeout` (180s) is too short** — a blocking plan blows it and the
  abort READS LIKE A PRODUCT FAILURE. Both cinema witnesses now set `protocolTimeout: 900000`. The
  wrapper's `exit=0` lied; the log is what showed the crash. Read the log, every time.
- **Hospital's editor does not open inside 300s under swiftshader** — P4's Hospital coverage is a rig
  limitation, not a gate result. Use **HHS_Office_Federated** instead (user's instruction: *"need not
  use DX et al, just HHS_Office"*), which completes and is where the 0.00m G-PA-3 came from.

**Branch: `bim-ootb` `fix/cpe-noise-law-dive` @ `5b63f1e`, pushed, NOT merged.** The user has never
flown any of it — their live Hospital runs are all on `origin/main`, which is why every "still not

## Do these in order
1. **Merge the branch.** Nothing below can be judged by the user until it is live.
2. **Build P4 — the rotation gate.** `witness_cpe_preview_divergence` was 3/3 BEFORE and AFTER the
   §CPE_BASIS_HALF_PIN fix, so it cannot see it: it moves the camera and never ROTATES it. P4:
   orbit while the editor is open, then compare the editor's last plan with the bake's on `yaw0`,
   `pitch0`, exit GUID and `finalSpinDeg`. **It must be RED on `origin/main`** — if it is green on
   both, the §CPE_BASIS_HALF_PIN diagnosis is wrong and its numbers need re-deriving.
3. **The 10s preview after OK (ask 5) — still unbuilt**, confirmed from their log: `§CPE_CLOSE` →
   `§CPE_APPLIED` → `§MAXQ_FRAME i=0` with no second `§MAXQ_PREVIEW`. Wiring job on the existing
   preview loop; must fly the EDITED plan through the same `poseAt` the bake uses.
4. **The dive base rate.** User: *"the dive in ... its same too fast"*. The law bends ±PACE_SWING
   around `CINEMA_DIVE_MPS = 20`, and measured only ×1.15 dive-seconds on Terminal. 20 m/s is 8.7×
   the walk pace and is a flat constant of exactly the kind `CINEMA_WALK_MPS = 1.3` was before the
   user called it a pedestrian. **Decide it with a number, with them.**
5. **T5 / T6 are RED and each needs a different answer.** T5: the walk's position step is 3.0x
   against its 2.4x allowance — REAL, caused by the noise weight multiplying an already-spread cost
   (worst case 1.5·SWING² = 3.8x). Decide: make the walk's noise weight mean-neutral, or state 3.8x
   as the walk's bound. T6: stale model (still plain smoothstep) AND it gates a stall the user has
   now ACCEPTED — fix the model, then demote it to a report, quoting the ruling.
6. **Outside the envelope the gaze spins away from the building** (user, live, not analysed).

## Rulings settled tonight — do NOT re-litigate, do NOT re-derive
- The noise ratio **governs throughout**, every beat, not the walk alone.
- The signal is **bboxes**, **100% rate of change**, no density term. *"if frame not changing, not
  matter how dense the animation is not moving makes a boring show"*.
- **No outside/inside or panorama special case** — *"We are in a range, thus no worry"*.
- **Stalls are fine**: *"a sec or two pause which is fine in the film"*; tempering is optional.
- **No clamps** — *"putting stupid clamps only breaks other stuff"*; fix the source instead.
- The MaxQ per-frame `STILL_REFINE`+`PHOTO_AO` cycle is the bake's DESIGN, not a defect.
- UNDO works (the earlier LIVE BUG was a wrong keypress) — do not rebuild the far-drag repro.

## Rig
`/tmp/wt-turn` on port 8403 serves this branch, buildings symlinked, clean and pushed. **Reuse it.**
`PORT=8403 node witness_<name>.js`. Read the log after every run — exit code is not evidence.

## Two live observations added at close (2026-07-27), both already half-answered
1. **"the trick to avoid wpt jump is to put a delay after dropping it, as holding it long ensure it
   does not jump"** — this CONFIRMS §CPE_DRAG_LAND_FIRST rather than adding a new cause. Holding
   still lets the in-flight 120 ms re-plan finish and settle BEFORE release; releasing quickly drops
   the waypoint while a ~1 s re-plan is still in flight, and it lands afterwards on a changed plan.
   The fix already on the branch removes mid-drag re-plans entirely — it is their "delay after
   dropping", done at the source. **They have not flown it yet** (branch unmerged), so their
   workaround is still the only thing available to them. Verify against this exact gesture after
   merging: fast drag + instant release, on Hospital.
2. **"if i do something else on another tab it may leak... giving it focus by going to the console
   seems to restore it"** — NOT a leak, it is background-tab rAF throttling, and the log measures
   it: on `§TAB_VISIBILITY visible=false` the fold's own timings balloon (`STILL_REFINE done
   elapsedMs` 850 → 11190 → 25589 → 45355; `PHOTO_AO totalMs` 750 → 21695) and `perFrameMs` goes
   2156 → 12168, ending in `§MAXQ_FRAME_TIMEOUT i=683 — capturing as-is`. Refocusing restores it
   because rAF un-throttles. **A frame captured on that timeout is a frame that never converged**,
   so a backgrounded bake silently degrades quality, not just speed. Same root cause family as
   §MAXQ_IDB_SALVAGE (which already blames background throttling). Options to weigh: drive the fold
   off timers rather than rAF, or refuse to advance while `document.hidden` and log the pause.
3. **`GL_INVALID_OPERATION: Feedback loop formed between Framebuffer and active Texture`** floods the
   console at load until Chrome silences it ("too many errors"). A pass is sampling the texture it
   is rendering into — real, unrelated to pacing, and it means those draws are DROPPED by the
   driver. Not diagnosed; note it before trusting any still/AO frame timing.

# §CPE_HOSE — the whole path editable, clips off it, and a construction checkbox
**Discussed and AGREED with the user 2026-07-28. SPEC-ONLY — nothing here is built, and the user's
own framing was "No hard laying out yet." What follows is the settled INTENT plus the traps found by
reading the shipped code; the build order and the open questions below are deliberately unresolved.**

## Origin — the user's proposal, verbatim
> *"I like to explore a bit on the alt-c mechanism we just did. U agree we use that? As i wana propose
> something that expands further the 3 point edit system. What if we make the whole path editable? And
> clicking any point will open an aribitary '3 point band' or just dragging a point where the whole
> path is like a long rubber hose, reacting only by proximity to the point been dragged, and the rest
> just curves along. The final start stop also draggable. Now the next stage is tricky but kills two

> user can create any walk thru or viewing talking point on the fly. And this construction bit is a
> checkbox to animate its buildup as cam goes along. As in movies or other's animation, its giving the
> impression and not chronologically accurate. But the elements laying on each other according to its
> part in the 4D is educational."*

## Why Alt+C is the right base — the reason is structural, not preference
The editor draws the path by sampling `plan.poseAt(t)` (§CPE_BANDS "Also asked" → shipped as the
full-film tube). **The tube the user drags IS the film the bake flies.** Any other editing surface
would be a second implementation of the path, free to drift from it. Cost is already measured and is
not a blocker: re-plan **13 ms Duplex / 82 ms Terminal**, sampling 240 poses **0.3 ms** (§CPE_BANDS).
Live deformation is affordable on today's numbers.

## 1. The hose and the band are ONE gesture at two falloff radii (agreed)
Rule 2 of §CPE_BANDS — *"the bands are short straight parts of the path… their length and
straightness does not morph"* — is settled and stays settled. It does NOT conflict with this proposal
once the two are unified rather than shipped side by side:
> **radius → 0 = today's rigid band pivot. Large radius = the rubber hose.** One control, one mental
> model. Do not ship "click for a band" AND "drag for a hose" as two affordances — that is where this
> gets fiddly to use, and it is the one thing in the proposal I pushed back on (user agreed).
This also answers **FOUR ASKS item 3** (*"the stick band should curve along more.. now it is short, if
twisted its curve still short.. having more make it more useful to craft"*) — that complaint and this
proposal are the same complaint, and the falloff radius is its general answer. Band tangent-authoring
survives: the tangent is still what shapes the curve, which is the whole reason bands beat points.

## 2. ⚠ THE LAW: falloff is measured in PATH ARC-LENGTH, never in world distance
A world-space influence radius deforms an out-and-back path's RETURN leg — 2 m away in space, far
away in the film. **This exact class of bug is why the `§CPE_DRAG_REACH` cap was removed** (#1038,
*"G-DRAG-3 measured it BREAKING out-and-back"*). A world-distance hose walks it back in through the
front door. Falloff parameterises on `t` / arc length along the path. Non-negotiable; witness it on an
out-and-back before anything else about the hose is believed.

## 3. Storage: store the DRAG OPERATIONS, not the resulting curve
§CPE_BANDS rule 6 stores **3 bands, not 6 points**, deliberately — rigidity then survives save/reload
*structurally*. A free-form hose cannot store a polyline without discarding that guarantee. Resolution:
> persist each edit as `(arc-length position, falloff radius, displacement)` **layered on the derived
> path** — not the deformed polyline.
Small; reload-safe; the authored intent survives a re-derived base path (different building version,
changed dive origin); and it composes with the existing §CPE_UNDO snapshot stack instead of fighting it.

## 4. A hose can make a curvature spike a rigid band structurally could not — SHOW it, don't forbid it
§CPE_EVEN_TURN, §CPE_POSITION_GATE and the jerk gates are all downstream of the curve, so they still
apply unchanged. But rule 8 stands — **authored is authored**, no collision fighting, no silent
correction. The editor should REPORT the jerk/curvature after a drag (the numbers already exist), so
the user sees what they made and decides. Correcting it for them would be the same paternalism the
band rules already rejected.

## 5. §CPE_CLIP — in/out markers. The cheapest part, and the biggest product win
`poseAt(t)` is already normalised 0→1 and `cinema_maxq.js` already accepts `opts.frames`. A clip is:
```
poseAt(t0 + t * (t1 - t0))
```
That is close to a one-line change to the existing bake loop. Named markers along the path ARE the
user's *"viewing talking point"*.
- **Markers live in the `bim_ootb_cinema_paths` IndexedDB store already sketched in §CPE_IDB_PATH_STORE**
  — same shape (many named entries per building, keyed `buildingId + name`). **Do not mint a second store.**
- **Two birds, and the second is bigger than clips:** the same markers can drive a LIVE walkthrough
  with stops, not only a bake. Author once → present live, or cook a film from any segment.
- Start/stop draggable (the user's *"final start stop also draggable"*) is the degenerate case of the
  same marker mechanism — t=0 and t=1 markers — not separate machinery.

## 6. §CPE_BUILDUP — the construction checkbox = §MAXQ_TIME mode D
Wires to `prompts/PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md` §MAXQ_TIME mode D (*construction ordered BY the camera
path*) and its 2026-07-28 code-read addendum. Mode D is a **re-sort of the synthetic build order**
(`injectGantt()` re-keys `start_ts` from arc-length along the flight) — no new render path. This
checkbox is its UI.

**The honest label is FORCED, not a hedge.** There is no 4D schedule in the data: `Terminal_Hi.db` has
no `tasks`/`task_elements` tables at all, `Hospital_extracted.db` has them EMPTY (`tasks=0`). So it can
only ever be a DERIVED assembly order. The user reached the same conclusion independently — *"its
giving the impression and not chronologically accurate"* — and the educational claim survives intact,
because elements still land in dependency-plausible order (Z-band + `SEQUENCE_RULES`). **Say "derived
build order", never "the schedule"**, or a BIM audience will ask for the P6/MSP link.

Two consequences, one free win and one trap:
- ✅ **Key the reveal to ARC LENGTH, not to time** → when §CPE_PACE_LOS slows the camera in a tight
  space, the buildup slows with it automatically. The construction breathes with the pacing for free.
- ⚠ **With a clip, compute the buildup over the WHOLE path, then sample it by the in/out window.**
  Re-normalising the buildup to the clip makes every clip start from bare ground — wrong, and far less
  interesting than a clip that opens on a partially-built building.

## Open questions — NOT decided, ask before building
1. **Falloff shape** — linear, smoothstep, or gaussian in arc length? Affects how "hose-like" it feels;
   pick by trying, not by argument.
2. **Is the radius per-drag or a persistent editor setting?** (Per-drag is more expressive; persistent
   is fewer controls. The "simplest fastest tour maker" scope guardrail argues for persistent.)
3. **Do markers survive a path edit that changes arc length?** A marker at `t=0.4` means a different
   place after a big drag. Anchor markers to arc-length-from-start, to a nearest waypoint, or accept
   the drift?
4. Does §CPE_BUILDUP force ARC-only (§MAXQ_TIME's ARC = 35,553 of 48,433 on Terminal), or is the
   discipline filter a second checkbox?

## Witness claims — write these before any implementation (spec-first)
- **W-HOSE-ARC** — drag on an out-and-back path deforms ONLY the near-in-`t` leg; the return leg's
  sampled poses are unchanged within tolerance. This is §2's law, and it is the FIRST gate.
- **W-HOSE-BAND** — falloff radius 0 reproduces today's rigid band pivot pose-for-pose (the unification
  in §1 is real, not approximate).
- **W-HOSE-RELOAD** — save → reload → the path re-forms from stored drag ops, poses match within
  tolerance (§3's structural guarantee).
- **W-CLIP-WINDOW** — a bake with markers `[t0,t1]` produces frames whose poses equal
  `poseAt(t0 + t*(t1-t0))`, and `frames` scales with the window.
- **W-BUILDUP-SAMPLE** — a mid-path clip with the checkbox on OPENS on a partially-built model:
  placed-element count at the clip's first frame is > 0 and < the count at its last frame (§6's trap).
- **W-BUILDUP-PACE** — reveal rate tracks arc length, not wall clock: where pacing slows, elements per
  second falls proportionally.

## Explicitly NOT in this section
Dive origin and orbit authorability (§CPE_BANDS "still open" — bands 4 and 5), the §CINEMA_SPACE
attic-pick (owned by another session), and collision avoidance on an authored path (rule 8 forbids it).

## §CPE_AIM_DENSITY — outside the perimeter with nothing near, turn perpendicular to the mass
**User directive, 2026-07-28, given with "proceed to implement":**
> *"when the rope passes the final building perimeter and no substantial building part nearby, then
> camera turns perpendicular towards the densest nearest part of the building."*

**Why it is needed:** the hose lets the user fling a stretch of path far outside the building. The walk
gaze is a LOOK-AHEAD along the path (`_beat3Pose` → `_lookAhead`), so out in open ground the camera
looks at *nothing* — empty sky/ground for seconds of film. This rule gives those stretches a subject.

**The trigger — two conditions, both measured, neither guessed:**
1. **Outside the perimeter** — the pose is outside the building footprint (IFC-space XY bbox, the same
   `base`/`envelope` the plan already computes), not merely far from the last waypoint.
2. **Nothing substantial nearby** — `_densityAt(pose, R_near)` is at/below a floor, where `R_near` is
   DERIVED from the building (a fraction of `envelope`), not a picked metre value. `_densityAt` and
   `_densPoints` already exist for §CPE_NOISE_LAW — reuse, do not invent a second proximity system.

**The aim:** find the densest cluster (coarse grid over `_densPoints()`, cell count scored against
distance so it is the densest *nearest* part, not the densest part of the site), then aim at it **with
the along-path component projected out** — that is literally "perpendicular": the camera turns side-on
to its own travel and faces the mass. If the cluster lies dead ahead or dead behind (the projection
degenerates), fall back to the unprojected direction rather than inventing a sideways look.

**Blending is mandatory, not polish.** A gaze that snaps on when the trigger fires is exactly the jerk
§CPE_JERK_DEFINITION and §CPE_EVEN_TURN exist to kill. Ramp in and out on smoothstep over a fraction of
the path, so the rate is zero at both ends. **Gate: peak deg/frame must not regress** — the existing
turn witness is the instrument, and this change must be run against it, not merely eyeballed.

Witness: `§CPE_AIM_DENSITY outside=1 nearDens=<n>/<floor> R=<m> cell=(x,y,z) elems=<n> perpDeg=<d>
blend=<w>` — plus the unchanged peak-turn number, to prove the ramp did not buy the subject with a jerk.

## §CPE_PREVIEW_BUTTON — a Preview button, NOT auto-preview (settled 2026-07-28)
User, in sequence: *"and the preview must always repeat each time an edit is done"* → *"Or a preview
button"* → **"thus no auto preview needed"**. Settled: **an explicit Preview button on the editor
panel.** It re-runs the existing 10 s fast preview on the CURRENT edited path. No preview fires on its
own — auto-preview after every drag would hijack the authoring gesture, which is why the user landed
here. Supersedes FOUR ASKS item 5's "OK → preview → decide" sequencing for the edit loop (the button is
available at any time, so the OK path needs no special case).
Small requirement that makes it useful rather than decorative: the button must show when the path has
changed since the last preview (stale marker), so "have I seen this version?" is answerable without
guessing. Witness: `§CPE_PREVIEW click stale=<0|1> edits=<n>`.

## §CPE_HOSE_BUILT — implemented and witnessed 2026-07-28 (`bim-ootb` PR #1074, `feat/cpe-hose`)
**23/23 green on Duplex + Hospital_3 (63,415 ops)** — `witness_cpe_hose.js`, `PORT=8421 node witness_cpe_hose.js`.
Built exactly as §CPE_HOSE / §CPE_AIM_DENSITY / §CPE_PREVIEW_BUTTON specify, with ONE stated
deviation (below) and three measured corrections that are now doctrine.

| gate | claim | measured |
|---|---|---|
| W-HOSE-ARC | falloff is arc-length, not world distance | out-and-back twin 0.5 m away in SPACE, half a film away in ARC — moved **0.00e+0 m**; grab point moved 12.000 m of the 12 asked |
| W-HOSE-REACH | reach governs reach | r=0.10 → span 0.195; r=0.30 → span 0.595; r=0.02 → 0.035 (the point-edit end of the continuum) |
| W-HOSE-PLAN | ops reach the FLOWN path | Duplex pathLen 15.3 → 132.5 m; Hospital_3 68.2 → 780.6 m |
| A1 §CPE_AIM_DENSITY | gaze turns toward the mass | angle to centroid 72.4° → 40.0° (Duplex), 75.1° → 61.7° (Hospital_3) |
| A2 §CPE_AIM_DENSITY | no jerk bought with it | peak gaze change **15.8°/f vs 15.8°/f** (Duplex), **43.5 vs 43.5** (Hospital_3) — zero added |
| B1 W-BUILDUP-SAMPLE | mode D opens a clip part-built | placed 0 → 59,161 (mid) → 63,415, monotone (Hospital_3) |
| B2 | mode D is reversible | `tmRestoreDerivedOrder` restores projectStart/End exactly |

### ⚖ THE THREE CAUSES OF THE AIM JERK — measured, and two of my hypotheses were WRONG
Recorded because the next session's first guess will be the same as mine was.
| # | hypothesis | peak deg/frame | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the argmax subject cell flips frame to frame | 78.5 | smoothing it made it **WORSE** (95.2) — not the cause |
| 2 | the perpendicular projection reverses as the subject crosses the travel axis | 95.2 | real (fixed by fading the projection with `k`), but not the peak |
| 3 | **the rule still held the gaze at the walk→orbit seam** (probe: peak at t=0.8706 against `beats.out=0.8700`) **and aimed against the INSTANTANEOUS tangent**, inheriting the path's own corner rate | 88.4 → 24 → **15.8** | ✅ this was it |
**Settled, do not re-derive:** (a) taper the rule to zero over `CINEMA_TURN_OVERLAP` so Beat 4 picks
up the gaze it was designed to pick up; (b) the travel direction is the local TREND (finite difference
over ~3% of the walk), not the instantaneous tangent — "perpendicular to travel" means to where the
camera is generally heading; (c) the weight and the subject are FIELDS along the path, probed at 65
samples and 2×5-tap binomial smoothed (the §CPE_NOISE_LAW idiom), which also makes the per-pose cost a
lerp instead of a density scan.

### ⚠ DEVIATION FROM §CPE_HOSE.1, stated not buried
The spec argued the hose and the band should be ONE gesture at two falloff radii, and warned against
shipping two affordances. **Shipped: both.** Band handles stay the precise/tangent control — they carry
the length and direction semantics §CPE_BANDS rules 2 and 6 structurally depend on — and the pipe drag
is the hose. The continuum is real and witnessed (reach 2% → 0.035 span, effectively a point edit), but
removing the handles would redesign settled, witnessed behaviour and was out of scope for this PR.
**If the user wants the full unification, that is a deliberate follow-up, not a bug fix.**

### Still open from §CPE_HOSE's own question list (unchanged, still needs the user)
1. falloff shape — shipped as `(1-u²)²`; one line to change.
2. reach is a PERSISTENT editor setting (resolved by the "simplest fastest" guardrail), 15% seed.
3. marker anchoring across a path edit — markers are film-fraction `t`, so a big drag moves what they
   point at. Not yet decided.
4. ARC-only for §CPE_BUILDUP — shipped WITHOUT the filter; the witness reports the ARC count
   (10,941/63,415 on Hospital_3) so the question can be answered from data rather than taste.

## §CPE_STICK — bands are N, not three (BUILT + witnessed 2026-07-28, PR #1074)
**User, after flying §CPE_HOSE on JKR:** *"So u still retrain those three sticks? I cannot do the
intended any part of hose to get arbitrary stick."* — against their ORIGINAL ask, which had two
halves and only one shipped: *"clicking any point will open an aribitary '3 point band' **or** just
dragging a point where the whole path is like a long rubber hose."*

**Their own log said why the hose was unreachable, and it was not the falloff maths.** Every grab in
the session was `§CPE_DRAG_SCALE grab band=… zone=mid`; there is no `§CPE_HOSE grab` line anywhere and
every preview reported `hoseOps=0`. Cause, from the same log: `§CINEMA_BANDS … flown=84` — the hose
hit-tests the WALK polyline, while the drawn pipe is the whole film. On that run the walk was
`pathLen=18.4 m` against `diveDist=67.6 m` and an orbit `granted=54.3`, so **~15% of the visible pipe
was grabbable and nothing showed which 15%.** An affordance you cannot see is not an affordance.

### What shipped
- **Click the pipe → a rigid band is seeded there** (`A.cinemaSeedStick`, in effects.js so the witness
  exercises the shipped function): centre ON the curve, direction = the LOCAL TANGENT, length
  inherited. Inserted in ARC ORDER between settle and stop, never appended. Removable via a `×` on its
  row; settle and stop are not removable (the dive lands on one, the orbit stretches off the other).
- **Click vs drag on the pipe is one grab, split by what the hand does** — release without moving and
  you get a stick; move and you bend the pipe. No modifier to remember.
- **The walk is drawn as a FATTER tube** over the thin film pipe, so the authorable stretch is visible.
  Dive and orbit remain underivable — this makes an existing limit VISIBLE, it does not remove it.
- **§CPE_PREVIEW drives the buildup** (see push-back below). **§CPE_PREVIEW_REDUNDANT:** the pre-editor
  10 s rehearsal is removed; it still runs when `opts.editor === false`.

### ⚖ SUPERSEDES §CPE_BANDS rule 1, and ONLY rule 1
"Three bands, one per anchor, no bands added or removed" is now "N bands". **Nothing else about a band
changes** — rigid length, end=rotate/mid=translate, tangent authoring, store-bands-not-points all
stand, and they are what make a spawned stick worth having. `_cinemaBandWaypoints` and
`_cinemaBandFlow` were already written as loops over `bands.length`, so the plan side needed NO change.

### Push-back the user invited, and the numbers behind it
> *"i dont expect buildup preview can be done as it be heavy engine work... I would expect maybe meshed
> batch or some occlusion happening"*

**There is no new engine work.** Time Machine already drives per-element visibility through BatchedMesh
`setVisibleAt` and InstancedMesh zero-scale matrices — that is what its playback does today on 122k-
element buildings. The preview moves the same cursor. Costs: re-key is a ONE-OFF 12–14 ms (1,120 ops);
per frame it is `renderAtTime`, measured in `TM_INCREMENTAL_RENDER_PERF.md` at 2.0 ms on the delta path
and ~23 ms full at 16k objects, and a 10 s preview steps the cursor far under `_INCR_MAX_SPAN_MS` so the
delta path engages. The one case that pays full price is DLOD engaged on a very large building, and it
is now VISIBLE as `§CPE_PREVIEW msPerFrame` rather than a mystery.

### ⚠ THE WITNESS WAS WRONG THREE TIMES BEFORE THE CODE WAS — read before writing the next gate
| # | instrument | read | why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | two films compared pose-by-pose at equal `t` | 98.4 m | a stick lengthens the walk, so duration and beat fractions move — equal-`t` samples land on DIFFERENT BEATS (dive vs walk). A re-timing, not a jump. |
| 2 | walks resampled by ARC FRACTION | 2.578 m | the stick inserts its own length, so the two polylines differ in total length and fraction-matching compares points offset by ~a stick along a curve |
| 3 | gated in absolute metres | — | a budget that passes on a house and fails on a terminal for identical behaviour |
**The correct instrument: point-to-curve (one-sided Hausdorff) deviation, gated at 0.6× the stick's own
length.** Replacing a curved arc with a rigid chord of the same length deviates by the sagitta, so "it
did not jump" means *the disturbance is bounded by the thing you dropped*. Measured: **0.640 m against
a 1.13 m budget (Duplex, 1.89 m stick, 15.3 m walk); 1.222 m against 4.58 m (Hospital_3, 7.64 m stick,
68.2 m walk)**; seeded tangent vs local tangent `dot=1.000000` on both.
Gates: **S1** dropped stick is a no-op · **S2** moving it moves the path (52.5 m / 500.3 m) · **S3**
removing it restores the film exactly (`0.00e+0 m`). 29/29 green overall.

### Still open after this
- **Dive and orbit are still not authorable** (§CPE_BANDS "still open" — bands 4 and 5). "Any part of
  the path" is blocked on THAT, not on the hose or the stick. It is now at least honestly signposted.
- Marker anchoring across a path edit (§CPE_HOSE open question 3) — markers are film-fraction `t`, so
  a large edit moves what they point at.

## §CPE_VISION_CHAIN — the roadmap in one place, so it isn't only in the user's head (interim capture, 2026-07-28)
**Not a new spec.** Nothing here commits to new build order beyond what's already ✅ elsewhere in this
file. This exists because the user laid out the full end-to-end chain in conversation and asked for it
written down before it's only recoverable from a chat log.

### Origin — the user's own framing, lightly cleaned up for reading, not reworded in substance
> *"Task data can be injected as the build sequence can base on later. Building in parts is on the heels
> of recent success of functional space injection giving awareness of where large halls, stairs and
> storeys are, a fast simple hose path is granted. Then it can be edited. Now the whole length. Then
> more build up animation — as a POC first. Then intelligent marker placing, i.e. set to nearest room,
> stairs climbing — all to lead in speed and ease of use, besides being utterly free."*

### The chain, mapped to what exists vs what's still vision
| step | what it is | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Space awareness | knowing where halls/stairs/storeys are | prior work, not owned by this file — see `FUNCTIONAL_SPACE_MGMT_NEXT_SESSION.md` |
| 2. Fast simple auto-hose path | GENERATE a first-pass path FROM space awareness, not hand-placed | **NOT built** — §CPE_HOSE/§CPE_STICK only EDIT a path that already exists from the Alt+C plan; nothing yet proposes a path from room/hall/stair layout |
| 3. Edit the whole length | drag-edit with arc-length falloff | ✅ built — §CPE_HOSE_BUILT, §CPE_STICK (N arbitrary bands, 29/29 green, PR #1074) |

| 5. Intelligent marker placing (nearest room, stairs-climbing) | §CPE_CLIP markers snapped to space semantics instead of raw arc-fraction | **NOT built** — §CPE_CLIP markers are `t`-fraction only; §CPE_HOSE open question 3 already flags they don't survive a path edit, and nothing yet snaps a marker to "nearest room" or recognizes a stair-climb |
| 6. Real task data injected later | replace the derived buildup order with an actual linked schedule when one exists | **NOT built, explicitly deferred** — the DERIVED-order honesty label in §CPE_BUILDUP is the placeholder; swapping in real `tasks`/`task_elements` rows is a data-availability problem, not a code problem, once a building actually has one |

### Why "free" is load-bearing, not a footnote
Checked against the closest professional analogues (2026-07-28 research pass): Synchro and Navisworks
TimeLiner do step 4 — cinematic camera + construction sequence — but require a REAL linked schedule as
input; neither has a derived-order fallback for a building that never got 4D data attached. Twinmotion/
Enscape/Lumion do a step-3-equivalent camera path but waypoint-based, not proximity-falloff hose editing
— and none of the four (Synchro, Navisworks, Twinmotion/Enscape/Lumion) are free. The chain above isn't
a cheaper clone of any one of them; the entry point (no schedule required to start, more accurate if one
is added later, free throughout) is different from all of them.

### Open, in the user's stated order — not yet spec'd, flag before starting any of these
1. Auto-generate a first-pass hose path from room/hall/stair/storey space-awareness data (step 2) — needs
   its own spec; nothing in this file currently produces a path FROM space data, only edits one that
   already exists.
2. Marker placement snapped to space semantics ("nearest room", "stairs climbing") instead of arc-fraction
   `t` — extends §CPE_CLIP and would resolve §CPE_HOSE open question 3 (marker anchoring across an edit)
   at the same time, since a room-anchored marker doesn't drift the way a `t`-fraction one does.
3. Real task-data injection path for §CPE_BUILDUP — **✅ DONE (witness) 2026-07-28, 16/16 GREEN on
   `feat/cpe-buildup-schedule`. See §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE (the spec) and
   §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE_BUILT (the measured result) at the end of this file.** §CPE_BUILDUP now
   branches: a building with dated leaf `tasks` reveals in real `schedule_start` order (proven on
   `TerminalHi4D.db` — 5 phases, 0 interleaving pairs, vs mode D smearing all 5 into 23 days with 4/4
   pairs interleaving); a building without one keeps today's derived order **bit-identical** (gated
   against a control repeat of the old call, `0/40` frames differ). Three findings worth carrying
   forward: (a) the "author a schedule in the Viewer and save it to the DB" half was **already shipped**
   (`schedule_author.js` / `schedule_editor_ui.js` / `foreign_schedule.js`) and was verified, not
   rebuilt; (b) `TerminalHi4D.db`'s schedule is `materializeDefault`'s output, **not** a P6 import — the
   id/naming fingerprint is decisive, so the "no float, no logic, no resources" honesty bound still
   applies; (c) the §BILLBOARD_INJECT panel + 4 floodlights are **already bound** to leaf tasks
   (Architecture / MEP Final), because `materializeDefault` covers 100 % of `elements_meta` by
   construction. One ⛔ question remains open for the user — see that section's "Still open".

# §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE — feed §CPE_BUILDUP a REAL schedule when the building has one (2026-07-28)
**Spec-first. Written before any code**, per CLAUDE.md §Standing Rules. Closes §CPE_VISION_CHAIN open
item 3 / chain step 6. Cross-references, does not repeat: **§CPE_BUILDUP** (the checkbox + the DERIVED
-order honesty label), **§CPE_HOSE_BUILT** (what shipped in PR #1074), **§CPE_VISION_CHAIN** (why this
is next), `PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md §MAXQ_TIME mode D` (the re-key), and
`prompts/archive/XER_IMPORT_P6_ADOPT_LANE.md` (the foreign-programme adopt seam — already shipped, NOT
rebuilt here).

## 0. ⚠ THREE THINGS THAT ALREADY EXIST — do not rebuild any of them (verified by reading the code, 2026-07-28)
This section exists to STOP a fresh session re-implementing shipped work. Each claim below was read out
of the actual files, not assumed.

| already built | where | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Real-schedule READ path** | `viewer/time_machine.js` `injectGantt()` → the `_cap` IIFE (~line 3121) | Probes `tasks` for **dated, non-summary leaf** rows (`WHERE schedule_start IS NOT NULL AND schedule_finish IS NOT NULL AND (is_summary IS NULL OR is_summary = 0)`), builds `guid → task` from `task_elements` (earliest-starting task wins on a multi-link guid), then OVERLAYS the real task window + real task name onto every covered element's `kernel_ops` row (`_captured=1`). Uncovered elements keep generative timing. Sets `_capActive`, `_coveredCount`, `_coveragePct`; logs `§GANTT_SOURCE captured …` / `§4D_COVERAGE …`, or `§GANTT_SOURCE generated` when absent. **`is_summary` is ALREADY honoured — the root task is already excluded.** |
| **Schedule AUTHORING in the Viewer, with DB persistence** | `viewer/schedule_author.js` (`materializeDefault`, `assignElement`, `activeSchedule`, `persistDb`), `viewer/schedule_author_ui.js` (✎ Author wizard), `viewer/schedule_editor_ui.js` (WBS/Gantt/CPM editor, `doGenerate`, `doImportP6`) | Writes `schedules`/`tasks`/`task_elements` directly and debounce-persists the mutated db back into the shared IndexedDB building cache (§SE-6, PR #770). **This IS "author a schedule in the Viewer and save it to the DB". It shipped.** |
| **Foreign-programme import (P6 XER / PMXML / MSPDI)** | `viewer/foreign_schedule.js` (`parseForeign` → `toScheduleData` → `adoptIntoDb` → `autoBind`), driven by `schedule_editor_ui.js doImportP6` | Same four tables. W-FGN 22/22 green. See `archive/XER_IMPORT_P6_ADOPT_LANE.md`; the write-back side is a separate lane (`XER_PMXML_WRITER_LANE.md`) and the real-`.xer`-fixture gate is still ⛔ (`XER_REAL_FIXTURE_PROOF.md`) — neither is in scope here. |

**Consequence: the original two-half framing collapses.** "Half 2 — author/inject a schedule from the
Viewer and save it to the DB" is **ALREADY BUILT** and needs verification, not construction. The only
genuinely missing link is half 1, and it is a *one-branch* defect described in §2.

## 1. The JSON-in / DB-out shape the authoring path actually uses (user: *"atm we working with the 4d json settings in view that users will either import to or edit from"*)
There are **two** JSON surfaces, and they are different things. A spec that conflates them will send the
next session to the wrong file.

**(a) `rates/sequence_rules.json` — the 4D *rules* JSON. THIS is the one the user edits/imports.**
`viewer/rates.js loadSequenceRules()` fetches it, deep-merges any user override from
`localStorage['json_sequence_rules']`, and applies `SEQUENCE_RULES` / `SEQUENCE_DEFAULT` /
`LABOR_RATES` **in place** onto the globals (object identity preserved, so existing references stay
valid). Fallback on any failure = the hardcoded objects. Logs `§RATES_JSON loaded=json|json+override|fallback rules=<n> labor=<n>`.
Shape: `{ SEQUENCE_RULES: { "<ifc_class substring>": {phase, sequence, resource} }, SEQUENCE_DEFAULT: {phase, sequence, resource}, LABOR_RATES: {…} }`.
The class→phase match is **longest-substring containment**, and `schedule_author.js matchRule` is a
deliberate exact replica of `time_machine.js matchRule` so authored phases equal what `injectGantt`
would have grouped.

**(b) `ForeignSchedule.toScheduleData()`'s return value — the *interchange* JSON.**
`{schedules[], tasks[], taskSequences[], calendars[], taskElements[], _meta}` → `adoptIntoDb(db, data)`.
This is the P6/MSP import shape only; `taskElements` is always `[]` (P6 carries no model guids —
binding is the separate `assignElement` / `autoBind` craft).

**The flow, end to end, all of it already shipped:**
`sequence_rules.json (+localStorage override)` → `SEQUENCE_RULES` → `ScheduleAuthor.materializeDefault(db, SEQUENCE_RULES, {start, phaseDays})`
→ `schedules`/`tasks`/`task_elements` rows → `persistDb()` → IndexedDB → next load → `injectGantt()`'s `_cap` → real dates on `kernel_ops`.
**This spec adds NOTHING to that chain.** It only stops §CPE_BUILDUP from throwing the result away (§2).

## 2. THE DEFECT — §CPE_BUILDUP destroys a real schedule 100% of the time
`cinema_maxq.js` (~line 724) runs, with no branch of any kind:
```js
_bkState = window.tmOrderByCameraPath(function (t) { … }, nFrames);
```
`tmOrderByCameraPath` (`time_machine.js` ~4873, §MAXQ_TIME mode D) **overwrites `op.start_ts` and
`op.end_ts` for every op** with `reveal = (floor(cameraS·frames) + zRank)/frames`, then re-sorts and
re-derives `_projectStart`/`_projectEnd`. It runs *after* `injectGantt()` has already written the real
task windows onto those same ops.

**Therefore: a building WITH a real linked schedule currently produces a byte-identical buildup film to
one with no schedule at all.** The §CPE_BUILDUP honesty label ("derived build order, not a construction
programme") is not merely cautious — it is currently *unconditionally true by construction*, even when
the data would support the stronger claim. That is the whole bug.

## 3. THE FIX — one branch, two new read-only TM verbs, zero change to the render path
**Non-negotiable: when no real schedule is present, the code path must be BIT-IDENTICAL to today.**
§CPE_BUILDUP's derived mode is shipped and witnessed (W-BUILDUP-SAMPLE, B1/B2 in §CPE_HOSE_BUILT); this
work must not perturb it. That is what `W-SCHED-FALLBACK` gates.

**3.1 `window.tmScheduleSource()` — a pure read, no side effects.** Returns
```
{ source: 'captured' | 'derived', leafTasks, summarySkipped, covered, total, pct,
  projectStart, projectEnd, ops }
```
built from the already-maintained `_capActive` / `_coveredCount` / `_coveragePct` / `_projectStart` /
`_projectEnd` plus a `tasks`-table count for `leafTasks`/`summarySkipped`. It must NOT trigger
`injectGantt` and must NOT mutate anything.

**3.2 `window.tmOrderBySchedule()` — the captured branch, and it deliberately does almost nothing.**
The correct implementation of "order the reveal by the real schedule" is **to leave `_ops` alone.**
`injectGantt`'s `_cap` has *already* keyed every covered op to its task window, `loadOps()` reads them
back `ORDER BY timestamp`, and `computeDays()` has already set `_projectStart`/`_projectEnd` to the real
project epoch. So this verb: validates (`_capActive && _ops.length`), counts coverage, **performs no
write**, and returns the SAME object shape `tmOrderByCameraPath` returns
(`{ops, placed, noGeom, projectStart, projectEnd}`) plus `source:'captured'` — so `cinema_maxq.js`'s
per-frame cursor loop needs **no change whatsoever**. Because it writes nothing, `_bkSaved` stays null
and `tmRestoreDerivedOrder()` is a genuine no-op: there is nothing to restore, which is *stronger* than
restoring correctly (`W-SCHED-REVERSIBLE`).

**Within-phase order is NOT flat, and that is already handled.** §PLAYBACK-STAGGER (2026-07-19) sorts
each task's covered guids bottom-up by `center_z` and distributes them linearly across that task's own
`[start, finish]` window instead of collapsing them onto it. So the reveal is *real phase order between
phases, real-Z order within a phase* — the derived Z-band discipline survives as the tie-break, exactly
as `zRank` does in mode D. Nothing new is needed for this.

**`wbs_parent` is NOT a sort key.** Ordering is `schedule_start` (present on every leaf). `wbs_parent`'s
only roles are (a) identifying the root/summary ancestry that `is_summary` already filters out, and
(b) a stable tie-break for two leaves sharing an identical `schedule_start`. Sorting *by* `wbs_parent`
would be inventing a hierarchy semantic the data does not carry.

**3.3 The branch in `cinema_maxq.js`** — replaces the unconditional call:
```js
var _ss = (typeof window.tmScheduleSource === 'function') ? window.tmScheduleSource() : null;
if (_ss && _ss.source === 'captured') _bkState = window.tmOrderBySchedule();
else                                  _bkState = window.tmOrderByCameraPath(poseFn, nFrames);
```
Every existing `§CPE_BUILDUP_SKIP` guard is retained unchanged. If `tmOrderBySchedule()` returns null
(schedule present but unusable), **fall through to `tmOrderByCameraPath`** — a degraded real schedule
must never be worse than no schedule.

**3.4 The user-visible label must move with the data.** §CPE_BUILDUP's "say *derived build order*, never
*the schedule*" rule stands **only in the derived branch**. In the captured branch the status string
names the real source and its coverage. It must still not overclaim (§5).

## 4. Witness claims — named before implementation, in the style of §CPE_HOSE's list
Rig: `witness_cpe_buildup_schedule.js`, same harness shape as `witness_cpe_hose.js` (puppeteer,
SwiftShader ANGLE, `PORT=8421`, real viewer page, `§`-log + numeric state only — **no screenshots**,
FUNDAMENTAL LAW).

- **W-SCHED-REAL-ORDER** — on a building whose `tasks` are populated, the buildup reveal follows the
  SCHEDULE, not the camera. Proof is numeric and cannot pass by accident: for every consecutive pair of
  leaf phases ordered by `schedule_start`, **max(reveal cursor of phase *i*) ≤ min(reveal cursor of
  phase *i+1*)** across all covered elements — i.e. phases do not interleave. Mode D provably CANNOT
  satisfy this (its reveal key is camera proximity, which scatters every phase across the whole film);
  so this gate is exactly the difference between the two orders. Report per-phase
  `[firstFrame, lastFrame]` windows.
- **W-SCHED-FALLBACK** — on a building with NO usable `tasks` (`§GANTT_SOURCE generated`), the code path
  is unchanged: `tmScheduleSource().source === 'derived'`, `§MAXQ_TIME mode=D` still prints, and the
  frame-by-frame `placed` series is **identical** to the same run with this change reverted. This is the
  regression gate; without it the change is not shippable.
- **W-SCHED-REVERSIBLE** — after a captured-branch buildup, every op's `start_ts`/`end_ts` equals its
  pre-bake value **exactly** (diff = 0 on all ops), and `_projectStart`/`_projectEnd` are unchanged. A
  bake must never leave the user's Time Machine re-ordered. (Stronger than mode D's restore, because
  nothing was written.)
- **W-SCHED-MONOTONE** — the captured branch still satisfies §CPE_BUILDUP's own trap: `placed` is
  monotone non-decreasing across frames, starts at/near 0, ends at/near total, and a MID sample is
  strictly between — so a §CPE_CLIP still opens on a partially-built model.
- **W-SCHED-COVERAGE** — the reported coverage is real, not asserted: `covered + generated == total`,
  `pct` matches, and the count of elements bound in `task_elements` equals what `_cap` says it covered.
- **W-SCHED-BILLBOARD** (§6) — the billboard panel and the 4 floodlights are each bound to a leaf task
  and therefore appear in the captured reveal, with their frame index reported.
- **W-SCHED-AUTHOR-ROUNDTRIP** — author → save → reload → §CPE_BUILDUP consumes it. Because the
  authoring path already exists (§0), this is a **verification** gate over shipped code, not a gate on
  new code: run `ScheduleAuthor.materializeDefault(db, SEQUENCE_RULES, {start:'2026-01-01', phaseDays:30})`
  on a building that has none, confirm `tmScheduleSource()` flips `derived → captured`, and confirm
  W-SCHED-REAL-ORDER then passes on that building too.

## 5. The honesty rule, updated — what may and may NOT be claimed
§CPE_BUILDUP's original label was forced by there being no data at all. With data, the label becomes
*conditional*, and it must still be bounded by what the data actually carries.

`TerminalHi4D.db` (`~/Downloads/OPEN SOURCE BIM/`, 306 MB, `building_name=TerminalMerged`,
`import_date=2026-05-02`) contains, **verified by direct query, 2026-07-28**:
- `schedules`: **1 row** — `SCH_AUTHORED | Authored Schedule | PLANNED | 2026-01-01`
- `tasks`: **6 rows** — `TASK_ROOT` (`is_summary=1`, name `Project`, 2026-01-01→2026-05-31, `P150D`)
  + 5 dated leaves, contiguous 30-day windows: Superstructure (01-01→01-31), MEP Rough-in (01-31→03-02),
  Architecture (03-02→04-01), MEP Final (04-01→05-01), Finishes (05-01→05-31).
- `task_elements`: **48,433 rows = 100.0 % of `elements_meta` (48,433)**. Superstructure 35,061 /
  MEP Rough-in 9,477 / MEP Final 2,377 / Architecture 1,260 / Finishes 258.
- **`resource`, `is_critical`, `total_float`, `free_float`: ALL NULL on every row. `task_sequences`
  table: absent. `predefined_type`: `CONSTRUCTION` on all 6.**

**PROVENANCE — settled by evidence, not inference.** This schedule was produced by
`ScheduleAuthor.materializeDefault(db, SEQUENCE_RULES, {start:'2026-01-01', phaseDays:30})` — the exact
call at `schedule_editor_ui.js:503` / `:653` ("Generate first draft" / "Regenerate"). Every field
matches that function's literals: `schedId='SCH_AUTHORED'`, `INSERT INTO schedules VALUES (…, 'Authored
Schedule','PLANNED', start)`, `rootId='TASK_ROOT'` named `'Project'` with `is_summary=1`, leaf ids
`'TASK_' + _slug(name)` (hence `TASK_MEP_Rough_in` from `"MEP Rough-in"`), 30-day contiguous windows
from `_addDays(start, cursor*30)`, `resource` written as literal `null`, and 100 % element coverage
because the loop assigns **every** row of `elements_meta`. It is **NOT** the foreign-import path:
`adoptIntoDb` would have produced `A:`/`W:`-prefixed task ids, `status='Imported'`, a populated
`task_sequences`, and an **empty** `task_elements`. (Recorded because it was guessed both ways during
this session; the id/naming fingerprint is decisive.)

**So the permitted claim is:** *"a real, per-element, saved phase assignment — five dated construction
phases covering 100 % of the model, authored in the Viewer and persisted to the IFC-native 4D tables."*
**The forbidden claims are:** "a CPM schedule", "critical path", "float", "resource-loaded", "imported
from P6/Primavera", or anything implying predecessor logic. **There is none in this file.** The
importer that *would* carry that data is shipped and separate (§0 row 3); this DB simply did not come
through it. Nothing in the code or the UI copy may imply otherwise.

**The two labels, verbatim, so a future session does not re-invent them:**
- derived branch → `derived build order (not a construction programme)` — unchanged from §CPE_BUILDUP.
- captured branch → `linked schedule: <n> phases, <pct>% of elements` — states scope, claims no logic.

## 6. §BILLBOARD_INJECT elements in the 4D — user directive: *"this has to be part of the 4D generate feature"*
The billboard panel + 4 corner floodlights (`PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md §12 §BILLBOARD_INJECT` /
`§BILLBOARD_ART`, SQL in `migration/billboards/terminal_billboard.sql` + `terminal_billboard_floodlights.sql`)
did not exist when §CPE_BUILDUP or the foreign-schedule lane were designed. **Checked directly against
`TerminalHi4D.db`, 2026-07-28 — they are ALREADY BOUND. No patch needed:**

| guid | ifc_class | discipline | bound to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BB0BIMOOTBSIGN000001A` | `IfcBuildingElementProxy` | ARC | **`TASK_Architecture`** |
| `BB0BIMOOTBFLOOD000001`…`4` | `IfcLightFixture` | ELEC | **`TASK_MEP_Final`** (all four) |

**Why it worked without anyone arranging it, and where the real risk is.** `materializeDefault` iterates
`SELECT guid, ifc_class FROM elements_meta` and assigns **every** element via `matchRule`, falling back
to `SEQUENCE_DEFAULT` when no rule matches — so coverage is 100 % *by construction*, and anything
present in `elements_meta` at generate time is bound automatically. The floodlights landed in MEP Final
because `IfcLightFixture` matches an ELEC rule; the panel landed in Architecture via the proxy/default
route. **The actual gap is ORDERING, not the rule:** an element injected into `elements_meta` **after**
the schedule was authored is left unbound, is skipped by `_cap.guidTask`, and silently falls back to
generative timing inside a film the user believes is schedule-driven. In this DB the billboard SQL was
applied *before* generate, so it is covered.

**Two requirements this section adds, therefore:**
1. **W-SCHED-BILLBOARD** (§4) asserts these 5 guids are in `task_elements` and reports the frame at
   which each is revealed — so a regression that drops decorative/proxy elements from the 4D is caught
   by a number, not noticed later in a film.
2. **`tmScheduleSource()` must report `covered`/`total`/`pct` and the captured-branch status string must
   surface it**, so a partially-bound model (post-authoring injection) is *visible* rather than silent.
   **Anything below 100 % coverage is a real, reportable condition, not a rounding detail.**
   ⛔ **BLOCKED — one user decision, not inventable:** *when a model has been edited since its schedule
   was authored (coverage < 100 %), should the buildup (a) reveal the unbound elements on their
   generative fallback timing, (b) hold them to the end of the last phase, or (c) refuse the captured
   branch and fall back wholly to mode D?* Shipping (a) — today's `_cap` behaviour, the smallest change,
   and the only option that alters nothing — and flagging the count in the log until the user rules.

## 7. Explicitly NOT in this section
A P6/MSP **importer** (shipped — §0 row 3), the P6 **writer** (`XER_PMXML_WRITER_LANE.md`), the real-
`.xer` fixture gate (`XER_REAL_FIXTURE_PROOF.md`, ⛔ blocked on a user-supplied export), CPM/float/
resource derivation for a schedule that carries none, a new authoring UI (shipped — §0 row 2), and
§CPE_VISION_CHAIN items 1 and 2 (auto-hose path, space-semantic markers) which remain unspecced.

## §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE_BUILT — implemented and witnessed 2026-07-28 (`bim-ootb` `feat/cpe-buildup-schedule`)
**16/16 GREEN** — `witness_cpe_buildup_schedule.js`, `PORT=8433 DER_BLDS=Duplex,Hospital_3 node witness_cpe_buildup_schedule.js`,
log `W_SCHED_run5.log`. Built exactly as §3 specifies, with **one measured correction to §3.1 that the
witness caught before it shipped** (below). **Half 2 was NOT built — it already existed** (§0); it was
verified instead, by `W-SCHED-AUTHOR-ROUNDTRIP`, over a real page reload.

### The headline number — the §2 defect, measured on both sides
Same building (`TerminalHi4D`), same 48,433 ops, the two orders side by side:

| leaf phase | `schedule_start` | CAPTURED reveal window | mode-D reveal window (the defect) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Superstructure (35,061) | 2026-01-01 | 2026-01-01 .. 2026-01-30 | 2026-03-05 .. 2026-03-27 |
| MEP Rough-in (9,477) | 2026-01-31 | 2026-01-31 .. 2026-03-01 | 2026-03-08 .. 2026-03-27 |
| Architecture (1,260) | 2026-03-02 | 2026-03-02 .. 2026-03-31 | 2026-03-09 .. 2026-03-28 |
| MEP Final (2,377) | 2026-04-01 | 2026-04-01 .. 2026-04-30 | 2026-03-09 .. 2026-03-28 |
| Finishes (258) | 2026-05-01 | 2026-05-01 .. 2026-05-30 | 2026-03-13 .. 2026-03-28 |

**Captured: 5 clean, non-overlapping phase windows across the real Jan–May programme, 0 interleaving
pairs. Mode D: all five phases smeared into the same 23 days, 4/4 consecutive pairs interleaving.**
That contrast is `R1` + `R2` — and `R2` exists precisely so `R1` cannot pass for a reason unrelated to
the fix: a gate mode D also satisfied would prove nothing.

### The gate table
| gate | claim | measured |
|---|---|---|
| SRC | the source is detected | `source=captured leafTasks=5 summarySkipped=1 covered=48433/48433 pct=100%` |
| **R1 W-SCHED-REAL-ORDER** | reveal follows the schedule | 5 leaf phases, **0 interleaving pairs** |
| **R2 discriminator** | the gate discriminates | mode D interleaves **4/4** consecutive pairs |
| **V1 W-SCHED-REVERSIBLE** | the captured branch writes nothing | 48,433 ops, `sumStart delta=0 sumEnd delta=0`, `tmRestoreDerivedOrder()=false` |
| V1b | mode D still restores exactly | `sumStart delta=0 sumEnd delta=0` after re-key + restore |
| **M1 W-SCHED-MONOTONE** | a clip still opens part-built | placed `0 → 45,248 (mid) → 48,433` over 40 frames, monotone |
| **C1 W-SCHED-COVERAGE** | coverage is real, not asserted | `task_elements` distinct bound guids **48,433** == `_cap` covered **48,433** == elements **48,433**, 100% |
| **B1 W-SCHED-BILLBOARD** | §6, the decorative elements are in the 4D | 5/5 bound: panel → Architecture (frame 23/39), 4 floodlights → MEP Final (frame 31/39) |
| **F1 W-SCHED-FALLBACK** | no schedule → refuse, do not guess | Duplex + Hospital_3: `source=derived leafTasks=0 capOps=0`, `tmOrderBySchedule()=null` |
| **F2 regression** | the derived path is untouched | Duplex + Hospital_3: branch result **exactly equals a repeat of the old call** — `ops`, `placed`, `noGeom`, `arc`, window all equal, checksum `sumStart delta=0 sumEnd delta=0`, placed series `0/40` frames differ |
| **A1 W-SCHED-AUTHOR-ROUNDTRIP** | author → save → **reload** → consumed | Duplex: `derived → RELOAD → captured`; 6 phases / 1,119 assignments; after reload `tasks=7 task_elements=1119 covered=1119/1119 pct=100%`, **0 interleaving pairs** |

### ⚠ MEASURED CORRECTION TO §3.1 — `_capActive` alone is the WRONG test, and the witness caught it
The first run failed at setup: `tmOrderBySchedule()` returned null on `TerminalHi4D` — a building with
a complete, 100%-bound real schedule. **`_capActive` is set by `injectGantt`'s `_cap` overlay, so it is
a RUN-SCOPED SIDE EFFECT, not a property of the data.** `activate()` deliberately SKIPS `injectGantt`
when the db already carries usable `ELEMENT_PLACE` ops with `_end_ts` (`time_machine.js` ~4462) — the
cached/shipped-timeline fast path — which is exactly the state of any building whose schedule was
authored in an earlier session and persisted. Confirmed by direct query: all 48,433 of TerminalHi4D's
`kernel_ops` carry `"_captured":1` and `"_task":"TASK_*"` with timestamps spanning the real
2026-01-01..2026-05-30 window, and `_capActive` was still `false`.

**Corrected rule, now in the code:** the source is decided by the OPS THEMSELVES —
`captured ⇔ (dated leaf tasks exist) AND (_capActive OR any op carries parameters._captured)`.
Coverage likewise counts `capOps` off the loaded ops FIRST, falling back to `_coveredCount` only when
ops have not been reloaded yet: `_coveredCount` tallies `_cap`'s UPDATE executions against
`kernel_ops`, so a db with duplicate `ELEMENT_PLACE` rows for a guid inflates it past the element count
(measured **2238 on a 1119-element Duplex** — a 200% "coverage" — during an intermediate run).
**Had this shipped on `_capActive` alone, the feature would have been silently dead on exactly the
buildings it was built for.**

### ⚠ THE F2 INSTRUMENT WAS WRONG TWICE BEFORE THE CODE WAS — read before touching that gate
| # | instrument | read | why it was wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | both paths in ONE page, compare the placed series frame by frame | 1/40 frames differed | mode D's tie-break `zRank = i/(n-1)` is the op's INDEX in the current `_ops`. Re-key re-sorts; restore re-sorts back — and for ops with TIED original timestamps the stable sort preserves the *camera* order, not the load order. A second pass starts from a different permutation. Pre-existing non-idempotence in SHIPPED mode D (its `noGeom` branch sets `camS = zRank`, so index changes leak into values), not a regression. |
| 2 | one path per FRESH page load | `ops=1120` vs `1121`, windows 4.6 s apart | `injectGantt` anchors the generated timeline on `new Date()` — every load has a different epoch — and the IDB building cache PERSISTS across loads in one browser profile, so a stray op from load 1 is present in load 2. A differential across two different inputs is not a differential. |
| 3 | ✅ **the correct one: a CONTROL.** One page. Three consecutive DIRECT passes (the old code), then the branch. Gate = branch **exactly equals pass 3**. | GREEN | Measures the branch against a repeat of the OLD call, so the shipped artifact is held constant on both sides. **No invented tolerance anywhere.** The control also proves the artifact converges: sumEnd deltas vs pass 1 were `0, -1.75, -1.75` (Duplex) and `0, 192, 192` (Hospital_3) — settled by pass 2, so pass 3 is a stable control. |

### What shipped
- `viewer/time_machine.js` — `window.tmScheduleSource()` (§3.1, pure read), `window.tmOrderBySchedule()`
  (§3.2, the captured branch — **writes nothing**), `window.tmPhaseWindows()` (§4, the aggregate numeric
  instrument: per-leaf-task first/last reveal + an all-ops checksum; never ships 10^5 rows to a caller).
- `viewer/cinema_maxq.js` — the §3.3 branch, plus the §5 status label that moves with the data
  (`🎬 Building to the linked schedule (5 phases, 100% of elements)` vs the unchanged derived wording).
  Every existing `§CPE_BUILDUP_SKIP` guard retained; a captured-but-unusable schedule falls THROUGH to
  mode D, never to nothing.
- `viewer/sw.js` — `CACHE_VERSION` v873 → v874 (both changed files are precached).
- `witness_cpe_buildup_schedule.js` — the 16 gates above.
- **No DB binary touched, no migration needed:** the schema already exists and `TerminalHi4D.db` already
  carries the rows. Nothing in this change writes to a building db.

### The §-log line
```
§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE source=captured leafTasks=5 summarySkipped=1 covered=48433/48433 pct=100%
  capOps=48433/48433 capActive=false window=2025-12-31..2026-05-31
  — REAL LINKED SCHEDULE, reveal follows schedule_start (no re-key, no float/logic in this data)
```
`capActive=false` in that line is not a defect — it is the corrected detection working: the schedule was
authored in an earlier session, so `injectGantt` never re-ran, and the ops themselves are the evidence.

### Still open after this
- ⛔ **BLOCKED (§6, needs the user, one question):** when a model has been edited since its schedule was
  authored (coverage < 100 %), should the buildup (a) reveal unbound elements on their generative
  fallback timing, (b) hold them to the end of the last phase, or (c) refuse the captured branch
  entirely? **Shipped (a)** — today's `_cap` behaviour, the smallest change, the only option that alters
  nothing — with the count surfaced in `§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE` until the user rules. Not encountered in
  practice yet: every building tested is at 100 %.
- **Two pre-existing defects this work MEASURED but did not fix** (out of scope, named so they are not
  rediscovered): (1) shipped mode D is not idempotent across a save/restore cycle — its `noGeom` branch
  uses `camS = zRank`, an index, so a tie permutation leaks into values (bounded, converges after one
  pass, `0/40` frames in the placed series once settled); (2) `injectGantt` re-run in place can insert a
  SECOND set of `ELEMENT_PLACE` ops on top of the existing ones, which is what inflated `_coveredCount`
  to 200 %. The shipped `tmRefoldSchedule()` (§TM-REFOLD) is the correct verb and avoids (2).
- §CPE_VISION_CHAIN items 1, 2 and 5 (auto-hose path, space-semantic markers) remain unspecced.

# §CPE_REPLAN_LAZY — cache the entry derivation; make re-deriving it a BUTTON (spec 2026-07-29)

**Item 0 of `prompts/CINEMA_DELIGHT_BATCH.md`.** Written before implementation, per Spec-First. Nothing
here changes the film's SHAPE — this is an equivalence-gated performance change plus one new control.

## 0. The defect, from the user's own console (not a hypothesis)
`§CPE_REPLAN_SLOW ms=600–1000` on EVERY edit on Terminal (48,433 elements, 4 bands). Across EIGHT
consecutive drags in that session, the expensive block printed **byte-identical values** — same
`§CINEMA_SPACE` candidate, same `§CINEMA_DIVE` settle point, same `§CINEMA_EXIT` door, same cost, same
runner-up. `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS ~550` of the total is that block: `fanRays=32 spaceCands=52 exitCands=135`.
A band drag changes the walk geometry; it cannot change which room the camera dives into or which door
it walks out of, because §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE already **pins the camera basis to the pose the editor
opened with** precisely so orbiting cannot change the film.

## 1. The seam — VERIFIED by reading the code, branch `feat/cpe-stick`
| what | where |
|---|---|
| `_cinemaPathPlan(durationSec)` opens | `viewer/effects.js:4572` |
| §CINEMA_SPACE chosen candidate | `:4749` |
| §CINEMA_DIVE settle | `:4795` |
| §CINEMA_EXIT chosen door | `:4874` |
| **`if (_cpeBands && _cpeBands.length >= 2)`** — the authored-path block | **`:4929`** |
| `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS` (plan close) | `:6135` |
So the PREFIX is `4572 → 4928` and everything the editor can touch — bands, hose, clip, pacing,
§CPE_NOISE_LAW probes, `poseAt` — acts at or after `:4929`. The line is clean and it is not a
refactor of anyone's working set to respect it.

## 2. Phase A — MEASURE BEFORE CACHING (no behaviour change, ship-able on its own)
Do not assume the 550 ms is where the prose says it is. Split `§CINEMA_PLAN_MS` into a breakdown and
read it on Terminal with 4 bands over 8 drags:
`§CINEMA_PLAN_MS total=<n> bboxMs=<n> spaceMs=<n> diveMs=<n> exitMs=<n> flowMs=<n> paceMs=<n> poseMs=<n>`
**This measurement DECIDES phase B's shape:** if `spaceMs+diveMs+exitMs` dominates, memoise those three
blocks in place (smallest possible change); if the cost is spread across the prefix, memoise the whole
prefix as one object. Either way the cache key below is the same.

## 3. Phase B — the cache key, and what is deliberately NOT in it
**IN the key** (anything that can legitimately change the entry):
`buildingId` · `A._metaGen` · the pinned camera basis (position, world direction, controls target) ·
the §CINEMA_PIVOT mode and pivot point · the arcBbox extents.
**NOT in the key** (all consumed at or after `:4929`): bands, hose ops, clip in/out, pace/beat-second
overrides, band count, undo state.
**Invalidate on:** any key change, editor OPEN, building switch, `_metaGen` bump, and the explicit
button in §4. Miss ⇒ recompute the prefix and log why (`reason=open|key|button|first`).

## 4. Phase C — `re-derive entry`, the control the user implied
> User: *"Cant that be lazy only when user press that feature?"*

Re-deriving the entry is a real thing a user may WANT — a different room to dive into, a different door
to walk out of — it just must not happen eight times by accident while dragging a stick. A button in the
CPE panel drops the memo and forces one recompute, logging `prefixMs` so the cost is visible as a number
rather than hidden in every drag. **This turns a hidden 550 ms tax into an explicit feature**, and it is
part of THIS task, not a follow-up.

## 5. Witness claims — named before implementation
- **W-REPLAN-CACHE (the gate — equivalence, NOT speed).** For N ≥ 20 random band/hose edits, the cached
  plan and the same plan with the memo disabled must agree on ~200 sampled `poseAt(t)`: position within
  **1e-6 m**, yaw/pitch within 1e-6 rad. Same discipline as `§INCR_VERIFY mismatch=0` in the Time
  Machine work, where an equivalence witness caught exactly this class of bug.
  *Proves/disproves:* whether the memo silently pins the film to a stale settle point or door.
- **W-REPLAN-INVALIDATE.** A building switch and a `_metaGen` bump must each produce a MISS, and the
  recomputed prefix must differ from the previous one where the model differs.
  *Proves/disproves:* the failure mode above — a cache that is never invalidated always "passes" W-1.
- **W-REPLAN-SAVING.** `§CPE_REPLAN_LAZY hit=<n> miss=<n> savedMs=<n> prefixMs=<n>` over a scripted
  8-drag sequence: hits = 7, misses = 1, and `savedMs` is reported as a measured number.
  *Proves/disproves:* that the saving is real and not a hope. **A regression in `§CPE_REPLAN_SLOW` on
  Terminal is the user-facing number this whole item exists to move.**
- **No regression:** `witness_cpe_hose.js` stays 29/29 on Duplex, with the D1 Hospital_3 known-limit
  unchanged (recorded, not tuned).

## 6. Explicitly NOT in this section
Any change to WHICH space, door or pivot the plan picks; any change to pacing (§CPE_SPEED_RAMP is item 6
and must never share a PR with a pacing change); hover scrub, room titles, cues, detours (items 1–5).

# §CPE_REOPEN_DOUBLE — the band count DOUBLES on every re-open of an authored path (2026-07-29)
> User: *"Bug where it seems to dupe more bars upon alt-c cancel and resume, so when i reopen saved
> path it gave me back my last count."*

## The mechanism, read from the code — it is exact, not approximate
Two functions with reciprocal fan-out, composed in a loop:
- `_cinemaSeedBands(wp)` (`viewer/effects.js`) emits **one band per waypoint** — `for (i = 0; i < wp.length; i++) bands.push(...)`.
- `_cinemaBandWaypoints(bands)` emits **two waypoints per band** (its two ends) — which is why
  `§CPE_OPEN` prints `waypoints = bands.length * 2`.

`open()` seeds from `a.cinemaSeedBands(plan.waypoints, plan.pathLen)` — **unconditionally**, including
when the plan it was handed was itself BUILT from authored bands. So once a path is staged:

| cycle | authored bands | plan waypoints | bands on next open |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | N | 2N | **2N** |
| 2 | 2N | 4N | **4N** |

**The count doubles per open, forever.** Cancel is irrelevant — `finish('cancel')` correctly returns
`override: null`; what feeds the doubled plan is the staging from an earlier *Save this path* / OK
(`A._cinemaPathEdit`), which the plan wrapper re-applies on every subsequent plan. And *"reopen saved
path gave me back my last count"* is `_pathsApply` behaving CORRECTLY — it restores exactly the record
that was saved, which by then was already inflated.

**This corrupts saved plans**, so it outranks the performance work: every save taken after a re-open
stores a band list the user never authored.

## The fix — the plan already carries the answer and `open()` ignores it
`_cinemaPathPlan` already returns `bands: _cpeBands ? …map(c,d,len) : null` (`viewer/effects.js`) — the
authored bands, verbatim. So:
```
var seeded = (plan.bands && plan.bands.length >= 2) ? plan.bands : a.cinemaSeedBands(plan.waypoints, plan.pathLen);
```
Middle bands are re-flagged `_stick: true` on adoption, exactly as `_pathsApply` already does, so the
`×` remove affordance survives a re-open. Derived (unauthored) plans are untouched: `plan.bands` is
`null` there, so the seeder still runs and a first open is byte-identical to today.

## Witness claims
- **W-REOPEN-STABLE (the gate).** Open → author N bands → build the override → re-plan with it →
  re-open: band count is **N, not 2N**, and each adopted band equals the authored one within 1e-6 in
  centre, direction and length. *Proves/disproves:* the doubling, and that adoption is not a re-seed
  wearing a different name.
- **W-REOPEN-DERIVED.** With no override, the seeded count and geometry are unchanged from today.
  *Proves/disproves:* that the fix did not alter the derived first-open path.
- `§CPE_OPEN` gains `src=authored|seeded` so a pasted console says which branch ran.

# §CPE_PREVIEW_AFTER_RETIRED — OK records; it does not preview first (user, 2026-07-29)
> User: *"also when OK, do not run preview again as there is already a Preview button"*

## This is the SECOND half of a cut already made once
`§CPE_PREVIEW_REDUNDANT` (2026-07-28) removed the 10 s rehearsal that ran **before** the editor opened,
on the user's reasoning *"I see the initial preview is redundant. Straight showing this is good as
preview button is always there and serving well."* The comment justifying that removal is still in
`viewer/cinema_maxq.js` and its argument covers this case verbatim — the pipe shows the path without
flying it, and §CPE_PREVIEW_BUTTON flies the current edit on demand, as many times as wanted.

`§CPE_PREVIEW_AFTER` — the 10 s flight that runs **after OK**, between §CPE_APPLIED and frame 0 — was
written for a build where **the editor could not preview at all**. Its own comment says so: *"Until now
the only 10s rehearsal ran BEFORE the editor opened, so it showed the DERIVED path… The film you
actually authored went straight to a ten-minute bake unseen."* §CPE_PREVIEW_BUTTON landed after it and
closed that gap directly, with a stale marker (`Preview ●`) that answers *"have I seen THIS version?"*
The post-OK preview has been ten forced seconds proving something the user already chose when to see.

## The change — one block, and only when the editor ran
In `cinema_maxq.js`, inside `if (_cpeRes && _cpeRes.override)`, delete:
```js
if (opts.preview !== false) {
  if (await _runPreview('edited', '🎬 Preview of YOUR edit (10s) — the ' + nFrames + '-frame bake follows; Alt+C cancels')) {
    _cancelledOut('the edited-path preview'); return;
  }
}
```
**`_runPreview` STAYS.** The `opts.editor === false` branch (scripted/witness bakes, where there is no
panel and therefore no Preview button) is the one caller that still needs a rehearsal, and it keeps it.
`opts.preview` keeps its meaning for that caller. Nothing else in the OK path changes: §CPE_APPLIED,
§CPE_CLIP, §MAXQ_START_REVISED and the frame re-derivation all still run, and guardrail 2's untouched-OK
no-op is untouched.

**What the user loses, stated plainly:** OK is now irreversible-ish in one respect — the last chance to
catch a bad edit before a long cook was that forced flight. The replacement is the Preview button plus
its stale marker, which is *better* (any time, repeatable, and it tells you when you are looking at an
older version) but it is **opt-in**, so a user who never presses it bakes unseen. That is the trade the
user is asking for, and it matches how they already ruled on the pre-editor preview.

## Witness claims — this RETIRES an existing witness, it does not just add one
`witness_cpe_preview_after.js` (4 gates, G-PA-1…4) exists **to prove the post-OK preview runs.** Deleting
the feature without re-aiming that witness would leave a green-by-neglect file asserting the opposite of
the shipped behaviour — the exact defect class §CPE_IDB_PATH_STORE's `waypoints=0` log and §CPE_REOPEN's
stale `_markClip` comment belong to. Re-aim it in the same commit:
- **G-PA-1 → inverted (the gate).** After an EDITED OK, **no** `§MAXQ_PREVIEW start phase=edited` line
  appears between `§CPE_APPLIED` and `§MAXQ_FRAME i=0`, and the frame-0 pose still equals the edited
  plan's `poseAt(0)` within 1e-6. *Proves/disproves:* that the removal cut the rehearsal and not the
  edit — a bake that silently reverted to the derived plan would also print no edited preview.
- **G-PA-2 → keep, re-pointed at the BAKE.** The old gate resampled the edited preview to prove it flew
  the authored film. With the preview gone, sample the first N baked frames instead: they must diverge
  from the derived plan's poses by the same margin the old gate measured. *Proves/disproves:* the same
  property (the edit reached the flown path), through the only flight left.
- **G-PA-3 → keep unchanged in intent.** `§CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE` still holds: the bake's frame 0 is
  the edited plan's `poseAt(0)`.
- **G-PA-4 → repair, it is ALREADY STALE.** It asserts an untouched OK gets *exactly one* preview,
  `phase=derived` — but §CPE_PREVIEW_REDUNDANT removed that derived rehearsal on the same day this file
  landed. **Verify its current state before re-aiming** (it may be RED on `main` right now, in which
  case say so rather than quietly rewriting it). Correct claim: an untouched OK runs **zero** previews.
- **No regression:** `witness_cpe_hose.js` stays 29/29 on Duplex, D1 Hospital_3 known-limit unchanged.

## Explicitly NOT in this section
The Preview button's own behaviour, the stale marker, the clip window it honours, or the buildup it
drives; the `opts.editor === false` rehearsal; §CPE_REPLAN_LAZY (still item 0 of the delight batch).

# §CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE_BLIND — Alt+C bakes mode D on Hospital, and the log never says why (user, 2026-07-29)
> User: *"another serious alt-c/TM interaction, Hospital has a proper schedule, but when done in alt-c
> it takes a bad one that flattens too much too early"*

**Diagnosed from the user's pasted console plus the DBs themselves. Four findings, only one of which
is the thing they saw.** Nothing here is implemented yet — this is the spec.

## 0. What their console actually proves
```
§TIME_MACHINE ON — 63439 ops, 182 days, project: 1/1/2026 → 7/29/2026
§GANTT_MINI tasks=36
§GANTT_CACHE_HIT ops=63421                        ← generated timeline, restored from cache
§CPE_BUILDUP ON — reveal follows the camera path (derived build order, NOT a construction programme)
§MAXQ_TIME mode=D … span=18042087338ms — DERIVED BUILD ORDER re-keyed to the camera path
```
There is **no `§GANTT_SOURCE captured` line** and **no `§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE` line of any kind**. Both
absences are load-bearing evidence, and the second one is finding 4.

## 1. Hospital has NO linked schedule — its 4D is GENERATED, and that is not a criticism of it
Measured on `~/bim-ootb/buildings/Hospital_extracted.db` (263 MB):
```
CREATE TABLE tasks (task_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, schedule_id TEXT, name TEXT,
                    start_date TEXT, finish_date TEXT, duration_days REAL, status TEXT);
tasks: 0 rows      schedules: 0 rows      task_elements: 0 rows
```
So `injectGantt`'s `_cap` overlay — the ONLY writer of `parameters._captured` — never runs, `capOps`
is 0, and `tmScheduleSource()` correctly answers `derived`. **`§GANTT_MINI tasks=36` is not the tasks
table:** `_ganttTasks` is built in `time_machine.js` (~3816) by GROUPING ops into phase × storey bands.
The 36 bars in the TM drawer are a view of the generated timeline, not 36 schedule rows.

**The user's premise is right in substance and wrong in mechanism.** Hospital's 4D *is* real work —
`schedule_gate.js` gates every element by its true geometric Z, bottom-up, in storey bands, and
§PLAYBACK-STAGGER spreads each phase across its own window. It is a deterministic, model-derived build
order. It is simply not a *captured* one, so §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE's captured branch is right not
to fire. **Do not "fix" this by loosening the captured test** — that would let the film claim a linked
schedule it does not have, which is the §5 honesty rule.

## 2. ⚠ THE DEFECT THE USER SAW — mode D throws the generated timeline away too
`tmOrderByCameraPath` **re-keys all 63,439 ops to camera-path proximity**, discarding the bottom-up,
storey-banded order the TM drawer is showing at that very moment. Proximity to a flight path has no
relationship to storey order: Hospital's dive lands at bbox-centre `settle=(-7.3,-14.4,18.0)` and the
walk is 73.6 m through a building of `boundingR=91.4`, so everything near that short walk reveals at
once, on every storey, in the first fraction of the film. **That is "flattens too much too early",
exactly.**

This is §CPE_BUILDUP_REAL_SCHEDULE §2's defect — *"mode D destroys a real schedule 100% of the time"* —
recurring for the GENERATED case, which that section fixed only for the captured case. The generated
order is also an order worth respecting.

**The fix is a third mode, not a widened test. §CPE_BUILDUP_MODE_T — "follow the Time Machine".**
`tmOrderBySchedule()` already proves the shape: it writes NOTHING and returns the same object
`cinema_maxq.js`'s cursor loop consumes, because `_ops` are ALREADY in timeline order the moment the
timeline exists. Mode T is that function minus its `leafTasks > 0` precondition. Selection becomes:
captured schedule → mode S; a timeline exists but is generated → **mode T**; no timeline at all →
mode D. Mode D stops being the default and becomes what you ask for when you WANT the reveal keyed to
the flight.
- **⚠ Do NOT delete mode D.** It is the right answer for a building with no 4D at all, and it may be
  the better *look* for a short film. It becomes a choice, and the checkbox grows a third state or a
  small select — decide with the user, do not invent the control.
- **⚠ Wording, per §5 and the three tiers.** Mode T is *"follows this model's derived 4D timeline"* —
  never *"the schedule"*, never *"a construction programme"*. Only mode S may say *linked schedule*.

## 3. ⚠ TWO INCOMPATIBLE `tasks` SCHEMAS — §3.1's query THROWS on one of them
| db | tasks columns | rows |
|---|---|---|
| `Hospital_extracted.db` | `start_date`, `finish_date`, `duration_days` — **no `is_summary`, no `schedule_*`** | 0 |
| `JKR_extracted.db` | `schedule_start`, `schedule_finish`, `is_summary`, floats, `is_critical` … | 0 |
| `Terminal`, `Duplex` | no `tasks` table at all | — |

`tmScheduleSource()` queries `schedule_start / schedule_finish / is_summary`. On Hospital's schema that
raises `no such column`, which the `catch` turns into `leafTasks = 0` — **indistinguishable from "this
building has no schedule".** Today that is harmless (0 rows either way), but it is a live landmine: the
day a building carries populated `start_date`/`finish_date` rows, it will be reported as having no
schedule, silently, and mode D will eat it. **W-SCHED-SCHEMA:** a db with populated rows in EITHER
schema must report `source='captured'`; a caught SQL error must log `§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE probe_failed
reason=<sqlite message>` rather than being folded into the same 0 the empty case produces.

## 4. ⚠ THE PREVIEW NEVER ASKS — `cinema_path_editor.js` calls `tmOrderByCameraPath` unconditionally
`cinema_path_editor.js:1001`:
```js
if (ok) bkPrev = window.tmOrderByCameraPath(function(t) { return s.plan.poseAt(t); }, 60);
```
No `tmScheduleSource()` consultation at all — the whole §3.3 branch exists only in `cinema_maxq.js`.
So on a building that DOES have a captured schedule, **the Preview button shows mode D while the bake
records mode S**: the rehearsal disagrees with the film it is rehearsing. It is not corruption — line
989 calls `tmRestoreDerivedOrder()` on completion, so the ops are put back — but it is the same class
of divergence §CPE_PREVIEW_DIVERGENCE exists to forbid, and it matters MORE now that
§CPE_PREVIEW_AFTER_RETIRED makes the button the only rehearsal there is.
**Fix: lift the mode selection into one shared verb both callers use.** Two call sites choosing the
buildup source by different rules is the root cause; a copy of the branch into the editor would just
be the same bug twice.

## 5. ⚠ AND NOBODY LOGS THE CHOICE — this is why the diagnosis needed a DB dig
`cinema_maxq.js:737` only prints when it TRIES the captured branch. When `source === 'derived'` it says
**nothing**: no line names the source, the leaf-task count, the coverage, or the reason. The user's
console therefore cannot answer *"why mode D?"* — it took opening `Hospital_extracted.db` to find out.
**Make the choice unconditionally loud, in BOTH callers:**
```
§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE mode=S|T|D reason=captured|generated-timeline|no-timeline
  leafTasks=<n> capOps=<n>/<ops> capActive=<0|1> covered=<n>/<n> pct=<n>% window=<iso>..<iso>
```
A pasted console must answer which order the film used and why, on its own — the standing rule from
§MAXQ_LOADED's *"u got to make the logs tell u"*.

## Build order and witness claims
1. **§5 first, on its own** — the log line, both call sites, no behaviour change. It is the instrument
   every other gate here reads, and it is what makes the next live report self-diagnosing.
   *Gate:* Hospital prints `mode=D reason=no-captured-schedule leafTasks=0 capOps=0/63439`.
2. **§3** — schema-tolerant probe + `probe_failed` logging. *Gate:* W-SCHED-SCHEMA above.
3. **§4** — one shared selection verb; the preview and the bake must return the SAME mode for the same
   building. *Gate:* W-BUILDUP-PREVIEW-AGREES — on a captured-schedule building, preview and bake log
   the identical `mode=`. RED today by construction.
4. **§2 mode T** — last, because it is the only one that changes what the film looks like, and it needs
   the control decided with the user first. *Gate:* W-BUILDUP-MODE-T — on Hospital, the reveal order
   must correlate with element Z (bottom-up) rather than with distance to the path; report Spearman
   against both, and mode T must beat mode D on the Z correlation by a stated margin.

## ✅ SETTLED SAME DAY — the user ruled before any of it was built, and it is simpler than the spec above
> *"do not bake anything for TM.. as i said, it is user's own plan"*
> *"this practices good separation of tasks"*
> *"so buildup it gives as it is basis"*

**The open question below is CLOSED and mode D is retired from the film path — do not re-open either.**
There is no three-way selector, no *"reveal along the flight path instead"* sub-option, and no control
to design: **Time Machine owns the build order, Alt+C owns the camera.** The buildup takes the TM
timeline AS IT IS and plays it. That is also the §CPE_BUILDUP_SETTLED ruling (2026-07-29c) applied one
level down — authorship belongs to the user, who previews the TM and places their markers; the camera
must not invent an order for them.

~~⛔ Open question: mode D still has a use — do you want it as a choice, or gone?~~ **Answered: gone.**

### Built and shipped 2026-07-29 — `bim-ootb` PR #1082, CPE v15, MAXQ v17, sw v880
One verb, `tmFollowTimeline()` (`time_machine.js`), used by BOTH callers. It writes nothing, because
`_ops` are already in timeline order the moment the timeline exists:
- **mode S** — captured/linked schedule; delegates to `tmOrderBySchedule()`, unchanged.
- **mode T** — this model's own derived 4D timeline, followed verbatim.
- **no mode D.** `tmOrderByCameraPath` is left in place and unchanged, and **nothing calls it.** It is
  still correct at what it does; re-keying a timeline to camera proximity is simply not something the
  film may do. ⚠ Do not re-wire it into the buildup path.

§4 (preview vs bake divergence) and §5 (nothing logged the choice) closed in the same commit, both as
consequences rather than as separate fixes — one shared verb cannot disagree with itself, and it logs
`§CPE_BUILDUP_SOURCE mode=S|T reason=… leafTasks=… capOps=… placed=… window=…` unconditionally.
§3 (the two `tasks` schemas) is **still open** — harmless today because both are empty, and W-SCHED-SCHEMA
above still names the gate for the day one of them is populated.

**Wording, unchanged in force:** mode S may say *linked schedule*; mode T says *this model's 4D
timeline* — never *"the schedule"*, never *"a construction programme"*. The checkbox now reads
*"build the model as the film plays (follows the Time Machine, not a programme)"*.

# §CPE_CLICK_SLOP — a click on the pipe can never spawn a stick, because there is no pixel threshold (user, 2026-07-29)
> User: *"when i made a new node in the pipe, it does not show up in the alt-c panel list as first time
> using. I know it can appear after refresh. But immediate as before is important helpful."*

## The mechanism — exact, from the code and confirmed by their own console
§CPE_STICK's contract is *"ONE grab, split by what the hand does: let go without moving and you get a
stick; move and you bend the pipe."* `h.up` implements the split correctly:
```js
if (!d.op) { if (d.hit) _spawnStick(d.hit); return; }   // never moved -> stick
```
**But `h.move` has no threshold.** The FIRST `pointermove` of any size creates the op:
```js
if (!d.snapped) { d.snapped = true; _undoPush(...); d.op = {...}; _state.hose.push(d.op); }
```
A physical mouse click emits at least one `pointermove` of 1–2 px in almost every case (tremor, or the
pointer drifting between down and up). So `d.op` is truthy by the time `h.up` runs and **the stick
branch is unreachable in practice.** The `mag < 1e-4` cancel below it does not save the gesture either:
at Hospital's `rate=0.192 m/px`, ONE pixel is 0.19 m of displacement — four orders of magnitude above
that threshold — so the click lands as a real, recorded hose pull.

**Their console proves it:** five `§CPE_HOSE grab` → `§CPE_HOSE landed` pairs (smallest `disp=1.84m`),
**zero `§CPE_STICK` lines**, and `§CINEMA_BANDS bands=3 waypoints=6` unchanged from first plan to last.
No node was ever created — the panel list was right.

## ⚠ And "it can appear after refresh" was §CPE_REOPEN_DOUBLE, which is now FIXED
That half is not a second feature — it was the doubling bug. Re-opening used to re-seed from
`plan.waypoints` (2 per band), so bends showed up as extra rows on the next open. §CPE_REOPEN_DOUBLE
(PR #1081, this same day) removed that, which also removed the accidental route by which a hose pull
eventually became a row. **Do not "restore" it.** The right fix is to make the CLICK work, which is
what the user asked for in the first place ("immediate as before is important helpful").

## The fix — a click slop, and nothing else
Gate the op's creation on the gesture exceeding **`CLICK_SLOP_PX = 4`** from `sx0/sy0` (standard click
slop; at 0.192 m/px that is 0.77 m, comfortably below any intentional bend). Below it the grab stays
a candidate click, the pipe does not deform, no undo entry is pushed, and `h.up` reaches
`_spawnStick`. Above it the gesture becomes a hose pull exactly as today — including `_undoPush`,
which must stay on the crossing, not on pointerdown, or a click would leave an undo step that does
nothing (the reason it was moved off pointerdown in the first place).
- **Do NOT add a modifier key or a mode.** The one-grab-split-by-the-hand rule is settled doctrine;
  this is a bug in how "did the hand move" is measured, not a reason to re-litigate the gesture.
- **Do NOT apply it to the band-handle drag** (`h.down`'s `hit` branch). That path has no click action,
  so a threshold there would only add lag.

## Witness claims
- **W-CLICK-STICK (the gate).** A synthetic pointerdown → pointermove of **2 px** → pointerup on the
  fat pipe spawns exactly one stick: `§CPE_STICK added`, `bands` N→N+1, a new row in `#cpe-rows`, and
  **no** `§CPE_HOSE landed` line. *Proves/disproves:* the defect exactly — 2 px is the jitter a real
  click carries, and it is what makes the current build take the wrong branch.
- **W-CLICK-DRAG.** The same gesture with a **20 px** move produces a hose pull and NO stick: one
  `§CPE_HOSE landed`, `bands` unchanged. *Proves/disproves:* that the slop did not turn small
  intentional bends into stray nodes.
- **W-CLICK-UNDO.** A 2 px click leaves the undo stack able to remove the stick, and a 0 px press
  leaves NO undo entry at all (G-DRAG-1's existing property, which must survive).
