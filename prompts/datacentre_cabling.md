# Datacentre Cabling — cable tray / containment pathing (KUL070)

```
# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE
SCOPE: cable containment (tray/ladder) TOPOLOGY and PATHING for datacentre models — the authored
port graph, cable pull-length routing, tray fill/segregation. Read the log after every run; an exit
code is not evidence. EXTRACT OR COMPILE ONLY — never invent a connection the model does not carry.
This file OWNS this topic. The 2GB-IFC ingestion lane (parse ceilings, splitting, extraction) stays
in prompts/IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md — do not duplicate either into the other; cross-link.
```

## §WHY — the user's actual question (2026-07-30)
The project's BIM engineer told the user they must do "something like cable tray pathing" **manually**
because *"Revit or the big tools cannot do it easily."* The user asked what he most likely meant, and
whether we can do it. The user's own steer, verbatim: **"since we have basis from rooms injection
pathing we can learn from"** — reuse the room-graph / A* substrate that already works here.

## §MEASURED — established 2026-07-30, verify before extending, do not re-derive
Every number below came from the real files on this machine, not from a run report.

**1. `CONTAINMENT.ifc` IS the cable tray model.** Not an inference — the product names say so.
`~/bim-ootb/IFC/KUL/KUL070-SWC-01-XX-3D-E-0001 - CONTAINMENT.ifc`, 56.7 MB, 774,041 STEP entities:

| | |
|---|---|
| elements | **21,009** — `IfcFlowSegment` 11,441 + `IfcFlowFitting` 9,568, nothing else |
| discipline | MEP = 21,009 (100%) |
| element names | `Ladder Vertical Outside Bend:Standard:…`, `Oglaend System_INS_vertical inside bend_OE FR:OE FR HDG:…` |

`Oglaend System` is a real cable-ladder manufacturer. "CONTAINMENT" is electrical-trade shorthand for
**cable containment** — tray, ladder, basket, trunking, conduit. The generic `IfcFlowSegment` /
`IfcFlowFitting` classes hide this: nothing in the class name says "cable tray", only the product
name does. **Any classifier keying off `ifc_class` alone will mis-read this file as generic MEP.**

**2. The source IFC carries a hand-authored connectivity graph — and we THROW IT AWAY.**
Counted by `grep -oE '=IFC…\('` on the raw file:

| entity | count | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IFCDISTRIBUTIONPORT` | 43,187 | connection points on tray segments/fittings |
| `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTTOELEMENT` | 43,187 | which port belongs to which element |
| **`IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS`** | **19,142** | **port-to-port — the actual tray network topology** |

In our extracted DB (`KUL_CONTAINMENT_extracted.db`): **`port_elements=0`, `port_connections=0`.**
The tables are CREATED and never INSERTed into, and `IfcDistributionPort` sits in
`extractIFCtoDB.py`'s own `NON_GEOMETRIC_CLASSES`. **19,142 authored edges are discarded on import.**

**3. We do have a DERIVED graph — but it is geometric, not authored.**
`rel_adjacency = 18,944` rows (all `provenance='derived:face-touch'`; axis split X 7,055 / Y 7,424 /
Z 4,465), from `extractIFCtoDB.py:derive_adjacency` reading `elements_meta ⋈ elements_rtree`.
Note **18,944 vs 19,142 — close, but not equal.** Whether the derived graph reproduces the authored
one was the pivotal open measurement — **now measured, see §AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED. Answer: no.**

> ⚠ **CORRECTION to the wording above (2026-07-30, survey):** it is not "bbox *proximity*". The rule
> is a **FACE-TOUCH** test — `_face_touch(a,b,tol=0.03,min_overlap=0.02)`: the axis with the smallest
> |overlap| must be within 30 mm AND the boxes must overlap ≥20 mm on the *other two* axes. That exact
> shape is why it fails on MEP (§AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED): it was designed for walls that abut, and a tray
> bend fitting does not abut its segment — it **interpenetrates** it.

**4. Consequence for `strip_ifc_nonessential.py`.** `IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md` §KUL004 has
`--tier model` DELETE ports (13.6% of CONTAINMENT.ifc) on the stated grounds that *nothing consumes
them*. If ports turn out to be the cable-pathing substrate, **that decision must be revisited** — the
losslessness proof there is still valid, but it proved losslessness *against today's extractor*, which
ignores ports. Flagged, not yet changed.

## §WHAT_REVIT_CANNOT_DO — three candidates, ranked
Marked honestly: (M) = measured here, (I) = industry knowledge, not measured by us.

1. **Cable pull lengths through the containment network — the strongest candidate.** (I) Revit's
   electrical circuits are *logical* (panel → load); they do not physically travel through tray. So
   "how many metres of cable from this panel to that rack, following the trays" is a graph
   shortest-path problem Revit has no native answer to. Done in Excel off drawings. On a datacentre
   this is direct procurement money. (M) The graph needed to answer it exists in the IFC — 19,142
   authored edges — and we currently discard it.
2. **Auto-routing the tray itself.** (I) Revit's "Generate Layout" auto-routes pipe and duct; there is
   no equivalent for cable tray or conduit — every run is drawn by hand. (M) At 11,441 segments +
   9,568 fittings, that is the whole job, by hand.
3. **Tray fill %, segregation, bend radius.** (I) Which cables occupy which tray, fill capacity,
   power-vs-data separation, minimum bend radius — manual checks.

> ## ✅ CONFIRMED BY THE BIM ENGINEER — 2026-07-30, via the user
> **He says all THREE are true.** Not one of them, not "mostly #1" — the whole list.
> This retires the guesswork above: #1 was the prediction, but #2 and #3 are equally real to the person
> doing the work. **Do not re-open "which one did he mean" — it is answered.** The consequence for
> §SPEC is that this is not a single-feature lane; see §CONFIRMED_SCOPE below for what changes.

## §REUSE_FROM_ROOMS — the user's steer, and why it holds (MAP REPLACED 2026-07-30, verified file:symbol)
Same shape, different graph:

| rooms (works today) | cable tray (proposed) |
|---|---|
| rooms = nodes | tray segments/fittings = nodes |
| doors = edges | `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS` = edges |
| A* over the room graph → fly path | A* over the tray graph → cable pull route |
| path length = walk distance | path length = **cable length** |

⚠ **`docs/internal/WalkerDoctrine.md` is LOCKED** — read it, do not re-litigate it.

### (a) DIRECTLY REUSABLE as-is — the whole reusable surface is four symbols
| symbol | what it gives a tray graph |
|---|---|
| **`viewer/navigate_grid.js:graphAStar` — :411-479** (exported `A.graphAStar` :537) | ★ **best reuse candidate in either repo.** `graphAStar(template, startIfc, endIfc)` over `{nodes:[{x,y,…}], edges:[{from,to,cost}]}`, index-keyed, returns the node chain or `null`. **Zero** references to rooms/doors/`IfcSpace`/storeys. Supply a tray-derived `template` and it works untouched. |
| **`viewer/navigate_grid.js:nearestNode` — :481-489** | snap a start/end pick to a graph node. **⚠ 2D only** (`dx,dy`) — see the traps below. |
| **`common/room_graph.js:_dijkstraCore` — :891-910 + `_Heap` — :1158-1161** | pure adjacency-map Dijkstra; the `graph` arg is dead. Currently **private** (not on the `API` export at :1465) — lift it to a shared module rather than exporting more of `room_graph.js`. |
| **`common/room_graph.js:fullConnectivity` — :818-861** | the island/component report, incl. its own hard-won `§NOT-EVERY-NODE-IS-A-VERTEX` lesson (:818-830): seed the node universe from *edge endpoints*, not from a node dictionary, or you invent phantom size-1 islands. Needs a one-line seed-filter parameterisation. |

### (b) REUSABLE ONLY AFTER GENERALISATION
| symbol | the coupling to parameterise out |
|---|---|
| `common/room_graph.js:_buildAdjacency` — :862-890 | keep only the `else` branch (edges carrying their own `w`). **Two traps, both must be neutralised before any number is called "cable pull length":** (1) the `E1`/`null` branch computes **XY-only** `Math.hypot(cx,cy)` (:869-871) — a vertical riser's length would vanish; (2) `UTILITY_EDGE_PENALTY = 8` (:105, applied :884) multiplies any edge touching a utility-classified room, so `shortestPath().distance` **is not metres**. Note the irony: the room graph *penalises* passing through the very cabling rooms this lane is about. |
| `viewer/navigate_find.js:_ensureRoomsCore` version-stamp block — :970-988, stamp at :1084-1098 | not code to copy, the **mandatory pattern**: `rooms_meta.version` vs the compiler constant, missing/mismatch = stale = recompile, log via `console.log` not `warn`. A tray artifact needs its own `tray_graph_meta` + `TRAY_GRAPH_V`. |
| `viewer/navigate_find.js:_roomGraphFor` — :1208-1215 | generic one-graph-per-building cache keyed on `A.activeBuilding`; only the body (`RG.buildGraph`) is room-coupled. |
| `viewer/tour.js:A._buildGraphRoute` memo — :426-436 | generic input-signature memo; only `storeyZ` is room-specific. |
| `common/room_graph.js:_astarGrid` — :1179-1223 | clean grid A* with an admissible octile heuristic (:1200), but its walkability oracle is hard-called as `_pointWalkable(graph,storey,x,y)` (:1183). Only worth generalising if a tray lane ever needs a *spatial* (clearance-aware) route; a topological pull length does not. |

### (c) ROOM-SPECIFIC — must NOT be forced onto a tray graph
- **`common/room_graph.js:buildGraph` — :217-772.** It *is* the room/door pipeline (`spatial_structure … type='IfcSpace'` :229-232; `ifc_class LIKE 'IfcDoor%' AND discipline='ARC'` :378-380). Nine edge kinds, every one a human-circulation fact. A tray graph needs its own builder; there is nothing to subclass.
- **The four island-bridging heuristics — E7 `§ORPHAN-SPINE-RESCUE` :519-534, E9 `§AMBIGUOUS-RESIDUAL-RESCUE` :487-503, E6 `§CIRC-PER-CHAIN-BRIDGE` :679-709, `§CORRIDOR-ROOM-BACKPROP` :269-326** (all log `§ISLAND_BRIDGE`). Each is justified there by real door+wall evidence for *human* circulation. **There is no equivalent evidence that two unconnected tray ends are electrically continuous. Copying any of these to reduce the 1,486 islands would be fabricating a network. The islands ARE the deliverable.**
- **`circNode` :391-399 + E2 :505-516 + `_publicHop` :941-950** — a fake `CIRC::<storey>` hub with no real position, plus the waypoint-substitution layer that exists only to hide it. A per-storey virtual hub is exactly the invented connectivity the Prime Rule forbids.
- **The door-buffer rule :465-473** (`buf = max(bx,by)/2 + DOOR_BUFFER_SLACK`) — a leaf half-span measured against Duplex. A tray joint's tolerance is a *fabrication tolerance on segment ends*, not a leaf-span buffer. Reusing 0.20 m here = a fabricated constant. Take only its **provenance discipline**: cite the measurement behind any constant.
- **The E1 two-closest tie-break :474-477** — encodes "a doorway has exactly two sides". **Measured here: tray fittings legitimately have degree 3 (992 of them) and degree 4 (37).** Forcing top-2 is the defect `§AMBIGUOUS-RESIDUAL-RESCUE` was invented to patch. Model tray fittings as multi-degree from the start.
- **E3 stair z-bridging `_e3Chain` :554-589 + `getStairGroups` :147-211** — a tray riser is a real geometric element with a real length; it needs no storey-bridging inference at all.
- **E4 exit doors :713-733, `escapeRoute` :1362-1404, `NON_ROOM_DOOR_NAMES` :107-112** — fire-escape + lift-name semantics. Nothing to do with trays.
- **The whole floor-legality stack** — `_pointWalkable` :969-1009, `_chordIllegalCount` :1016-1028, `_legalizePath` :1119-1135, `_detourCandidates/_detourDijkstra/_detourForChord` :1050-1112, `_simplifyLOS` :1228-1237, `_astarHop` :1244-1282, `_buildPolyline` :1288-1328. It answers "does a human's footstep land on real slab, per storey, in 2D". A tray is suspended and crosses slabs; its validity condition is joint continuity. `_detourCandidates` (:1063) admits only `doorwp`/`spine`/`circ` — door-portal midpoints as the entire waypoint vocabulary.
- **`common/hallway_backbone.js` — the ENTIRE module (733 lines)**: `buildBackbone` :460-531, `correlateDoorEdges` :225, `joinDoorways` :256 (`minDoorsForHallway: 3`), `growToWall` :275, `terminateAtStair` :358, `classifyCorridorRooms` :~660-712, `DEFAULT_PROFILE`. A corridor centreline *hypothesised* from ≥3 collinear doors — geometry that was never modelled. **Cable containment IS already explicitly modelled as real elements. There is nothing to infer a spine for, and inferring one would replace real geometry with a guess.**
- **`viewer/tour.js:_buildGraphRouteInner` — :437-643** — an itinerary planner for a camera (label-string room classification :453-454, area-ranked "drama" stops :494-495, per-storey budget `K` :461, `pause:'room'|'storey'` beats, `§MAJORITY-LEGAL` reject :635-640).
- **`build/room_walker.js` / `scripts/compile_rooms.py` — whole files.** Wall-raster flood-fill room compilation (`flood_rooms` py:553, `partition_by_doors` py:740, `_inscribed_rect`, `OPEN_PERIM_FACTOR`, `DOOR_SHORTFALL_RATIO 0.15`). **No nodes, no edges, no weights, no graph search** — the nearest-door BFS is over a wall-occupancy *bitmap*. Its own `§DOOR-PARTITION` guard (py:671-710) exists because flood-fill can't find rooms on sparse models — a failure mode with no tray analogue. Nothing here is a reuse candidate.

### Negative result worth recording
`grep -E 'dijkstra|astar|heapq|priority_queue|shortest_path'` across every non-vendored `.py` in both
repos returns **no graph search at all** on the Python side (only `deploy/boq_export.py`, a rate table
that happens to mention cable tray). Any compiler-side tray graph is greenfield Python; the reusable
search code is all JS.

The room precedent also carries a warning worth copying: `navigate_find.js` compiles rooms from
walls/doors and **refuses honestly (`roomsWritten=0`) if the building lacks them — never invents
rooms.** A tray walker must refuse the same way rather than bridge a gap the model does not have.

## §OPEN — ✅ items 1-3 CLOSED 2026-07-30 (survey); item 4 still open
1. ✅ **Does `rel_adjacency` reproduce the authored graph?** **NO** — precision 74.58%, recall 73.81%.
   → §AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED. The errors are *systematic*, not noise, and a better geometric rule exists.
2. ✅ **Connected-component count of the authored graph.** **1,486 components over connected nodes;
   1,945 including the 459 isolated products. Largest = 2,134 elements = 10.16% of the model.**
   → §GRAPH_MEASURED. The network is **fragmented — cables cannot be routed end to end** over the
   authored graph alone.
3. ✅ **Real pull lengths.** Measured, named pairs, in metres → §PULL_LENGTHS. **⚠ CORRECTION to this
   item's own instruction:** do **not** use `element_transforms` centres — that column is the
   placement ORIGIN, median **11.31 m** away from the element on this model. Use `elements_rtree`.
   → §SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE.
4. ✅ **CLOSED 2026-07-30 — the engineer confirmed ALL THREE of §WHAT_REVIT_CANNOT_DO are true.**
   No longer an open question. See §CONFIRMED_SCOPE.

# SURVEY RESULTS — 2026-07-30 (read-only; every number below is counted, none estimated)

Scripts + logs are scratch (not committed, per the no-`.db`/no-scratch-in-repo rule); each claim
carries its `§` log line so it is re-derivable. Sources read: `CONTAINMENT.ifc` (raw STEP, streamed),
`KUL_CONTAINMENT_extracted.db` (`mode=ro`), `KUL_EQUIPMENT_extracted.db`, `Duplex_mep_extracted.db`,
`extractIFCtoDB.py`, `strip_ifc_nonessential.py`, `build/disc_walker.js`, `scripts/witness_walkback_mep.js`.

## §GRAPH_MEASURED — what the authored port graph actually is

Parsed straight from the STEP file (774,052 lines / **260,547 rooted objects** — consistent with
§KUL004's 774,041 entities + the header/footer lines). The coordinator's §MEASURED table is **exactly
right**, confirmed independently: `IFCDISTRIBUTIONPORT` 43,187 · `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTTOELEMENT` 43,187 ·
`IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS` 19,142 · `IFCFLOWSEGMENT` 11,441 · `IFCFLOWFITTING` 9,568. Nothing to correct.

```
§TRAY_AUTHORED ports=43187 rel_port_to_element=43187 rel_connects_ports=19142
§TRAY_AUTHORED ports_bound_to_element=43187 ports_unbound=0 conflicting_bindings=0
§TRAY_AUTHORED element_edges_unique=19142 port_pair_rows=19142 self_loops=0 unresolvable=0
§TRAY_AUTHORED graph_nodes=20550 product_elements=21009 products_not_in_graph=459
§TRAY_AUTHORED node_class_histogram=[["IFCFLOWSEGMENT",11111],["IFCFLOWFITTING",9439]]
```

**The graph resolves perfectly.** Every one of the 43,187 ports binds to exactly one element with zero
conflicts; every one of the 19,142 port-pairs resolves to a distinct element-to-element edge — no self
loops, no dangling references, no de-duplication needed. This is a *clean, complete, hand-authored
topology*. It is not partial data we would have to repair.

### The headline number: **1,486 components. It is NOT one navigable network.**
```
§TRAY_AUTHORED components_connected_only=1486 sizes_top15=[2134,667,458,299,298,260,251,229,218,213,211,211,182,180,171] sum=20550
§TRAY_AUTHORED components_incl_isolated=1945 singletons=459 size2=140 size_ge10=291
§TRAY_AUTHORED top1_pct_of_products=10.16
```
The largest connected run is **2,134 elements = 10.16%** of the model. 459 products are completely
isolated (no port connection at all); 140 more are lone pairs. **A cable cannot be pulled end to end
across this building on the authored graph** — any whole-building pull length would require bridging a
gap the model does not assert. That is forbidden by the Prime Rule, and it is the single most important
finding for scoping this lane.

### Shape of the network — it is a chain graph, not a mesh
```
§TRAY_AUTHORED degree_histogram=[[1,3891],[2,15622],[3,999],[4,38]]
§TRAY_AUTHORED deadends_deg1=3891 deg0_products=459 max_degree=4
§TRAY_AUTHORED ports_per_element_histogram=[[1,11],[2,19862],[3,1089],[4,45],[5,1]]
§TRAY_AUTHORED ports_with_a_connection=38284 ports_dangling=4903
```
76% of nodes have degree exactly 2 (a run passing through). **Max degree is 4** — tees (999 at degree 3)
and crosses (38 at degree 4) are the only branching. **3,891 dead ends** — these are the real cable
drop / termination candidates, and they are *data*, not a defect. **4,903 ports are authored but
connected to nothing** (11.4% of all ports) — open tray ends, i.e. where the containment stops.

### Geometric cross-validation — the authored graph is TRUE, not just present
```
§TRAY_GEO authored_AABB_gap_m n=19142 p50=0.0000 p90=0.0000 p99=0.0000 max=0.3311 zero=19139
§TRAY_GEO authored_centre_dist_via_RTREE n=19142 p05=0.091 p50=0.471 p95=4.375 max=27.864
```
**19,139 of 19,142 authored edges have a literally ZERO AABB gap** — the two elements physically touch.
Worst case in the whole file is 0.33 m. The authored topology and the geometry agree. This is the
strongest single argument for persisting ports: they are free, exact, and independently confirmed.

### The full model carries even more of it
`grep` on the 2.0 GB `OVERALL.ifc`: `IFCDISTRIBUTIONPORT` **55,561** · `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTTOELEMENT`
**55,561** · `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS` **24,366**. So the complete E-series model has ~27% more authored
edges than CONTAINMENT alone (the extra are the EQUIPMENT-side ports — panel/busway connection points,
i.e. exactly the *sources and sinks* a pull-length query needs at the ends of a tray route).

## §AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED — geometry does NOT reproduce the authored graph, and the failure is systematic

```
§TRAY_CMP authored=19142 derived=18944 intersection=14129
§TRAY_CMP precision_derived_edges_that_are_authored=74.58% recall_authored_edges_found_by_derived=73.81%
§TRAY_CMP authored_only=5013 derived_only=4815
```
F1 = 74.19. **Answer to §OPEN 1: no.** But "18,944 ≈ 19,142" was a coincidence of totals — the two sets
differ on ~5,000 edges in *each* direction. Both error classes have a single, diagnosable cause.

### Why face-touch MISSES 5,013 real joints: MEP fittings interpenetrate, they do not abut
```
§TRAY_EDGEQ authored_only n=5013 why_face_touch_missed=[["gap_or_clash_exceeds_tol_30mm",5012],["overlap_on_other_axes_below_20mm_min_overlap",1]]
§TRAY_EDGEQ authored_only AABB_gap_m p50=0.0000 p95=0.0000 max=0.3311 zero=5011
```
**5,011 of the 5,013 missed edges have a ZERO AABB gap — the elements are touching.** `_face_touch`
rejects them anyway, because it picks the axis of *smallest* |overlap| and requires it to be ≤30 mm:
when a bend fitting's box overlaps a tray segment's box substantially on **all three** axes, no axis is
near zero, so the rule classifies a genuine coupling as a "deep clash" and discards it. The rule is
correct for its design case (two walls back to back). It is **structurally wrong for MEP**, where the
joint is a socket/flange overlap. This is a real, named defect in `derive_adjacency`, not a tolerance
that needs widening.

### Why face-touch ADDS 4,815 edges the authored graph denies: parallel trays resting on each other
Discriminator, measured per edge: is the touch axis the element's own **longest** axis (an end-butt) or
a transverse one (a tray laid across/against another)?
```
§TRAY_EDGEQ confirmed_both  n=14129 END_BUTT=12792 (90.5%) TRANSVERSE=1337 (9.5%)
§TRAY_EDGEQ confirmed_both  contact_m2 p50=0.0200  gap_mm p50=0.492 p95=1.961
§TRAY_EDGEQ confirmed_both  class_pairs=[["Seg|Fit",7112],["Fit|Seg",6700],["Fit|Fit",293],["Seg|Seg",24]]
§TRAY_EDGEQ derived_only    n=4815  END_BUTT=2262 (47.0%) TRANSVERSE=2553 (53.0%)
§TRAY_EDGEQ derived_only    contact_m2 p50=0.0171  gap_mm p50=6.832 p95=27.345
§TRAY_EDGEQ derived_only    class_pairs=[["Seg|Seg",2359],["Fit|Fit",995],["Fit|Seg",750],["Seg|Fit",711]]
```
Three independent signatures separate them:
1. **Class pair.** Real containment topology is *always* segment→fitting→segment: **13,812 of 14,129
   (97.8%)** confirmed edges are `Segment|Fitting`, and only **24** are `Segment|Segment`. The
   derived-only set is *led* by `Segment|Segment` (2,359) — parallel trays in the same cable route,
   physically touching, electrically two different runs.
2. **Touch orientation.** 90.5% end-butt when real, 47.0% when spurious.
3. **Gap.** p50 0.49 mm when real (a modelled coupling), 6.83 mm when spurious (an incidental contact
   living off the 30 mm tolerance).

### A better purely-geometric rule exists — and it nearly matches the authored graph
Scored against the 19,142 authored edges as ground truth (the first time such an oracle has existed on
this project — `witness_walkback_mep.js` states, correctly for its own substrates, that no
recorded-topology oracle was available):
```
§TRAY_ALTRULE RULE_A aabb_proximity_30mm                        edges=26629 precision=71.88% recall=99.99% F1=83.63

```
Shipped `derive_adjacency` = **F1 74.19**. RULE_C = **F1 95.83** from three lines of change. Note also
that RULE_A recovers **99.99%** of authored edges — i.e. **essentially every authored connection is
geometrically discoverable**; the shipped rule's low recall is entirely its own filter, not missing data.
RULE_E confirms the degree cap is the wrong lever (`§TRAY_ALTRULE authored_degree_by_class
IfcFlowFitting [[1,518],[2,7892],[3,992],[4,37]]` — capping at 2 destroys every tee and cross).

### And yet: a better geometric graph is still not the authored graph
```
§TRAY_RULEC AUTHORED         edges=19142 components=1945 largest_share=10.16% singletons=459
§TRAY_RULEC RULE_C           edges=20106 components=1540 largest_share=53.90% singletons=546
§TRAY_RULEC AUTH_UNION_RULEC edges=20442 components=1266 largest_share=57.03% singletons=307
§TRAY_EDGEQ union_components(authored ∪ shipped rel_adjacency)=589 largest_share=86.60%
```
Read that last line carefully — **the shipped rule's union looks "better connected" (86.6%) precisely
because its false positives glue unrelated runs together.** Higher connectivity is *not* the quality
metric here; a spurious side-contact between two parallel trays creates a route a cable cannot take.
This is the trap to avoid if anyone is ever tempted to tune for a bigger component.

### Verdict on §OPEN 1
**We need the ports.** They are exact (19,142/19,142 resolve), independently geometry-confirmed
(19,139 zero-gap), free (already in the file), and they carry a distinction no bbox rule can ever
recover: *this* contact is a coupling, *that* one is two trays touching. Geometry with a fixed
`derive_adjacency` (RULE_C) is a good **fallback for models that ship no ports** — and it should be
built, because most of the fleet has none — but it is a 93.5%-precision approximation of something we
are currently deleting at 100% fidelity.

## §PULL_LENGTHS — yes, the graph is metrically usable; here are real metres

Node position = `elements_rtree` AABB centre. Edge weight = Euclidean centre-to-centre (a centreline
approximation over a chain whose median hop is 0.47 m). **Not** `element_transforms.center` — see
§SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE.

```
§TRAY_PATH authored_edges_with_geometry=19142 total_centreline_sum_m=22406.3
§TRAY_PATH edge_len_m p05=0.091 p50=0.471 p95=4.375 max=27.864
§TRAY_PATH longest_elements=[[55.53,"Cable Tray with Fittings:Trunking:50354710"],[55.15,"…:98393108"],[54.09,"…:50354686"]]
```
**~22.4 km of containment centreline in this one model.** (Single longest element: a 55.53 m trunking run.)

### Largest authored component — a measured 324.71 m pull
```
§TRAY_PATH comp0 n=2134 bbox_span=(100.0,84.2,11.5)m storeys=[["Level 0",2052],["Level 0.5 Plenum - Mezzanine",77],["0.0 - G.F.L",4],["Level 1",1]]
§TRAY_PATH comp0 DIAMETER pull_len=324.71m hops=249 straight_line=41.06m tortuosity=7.91
§TRAY_PATH comp0   A=2W5MtY1$rFROvHu5DQvtiD [Cable Tray with Fittings:Trunking:50354684] storey=Level 0.5 Plenum - Mezzanine
§TRAY_PATH comp0   B=2Tm3yzBML8PRVWWPREg0ua [Cable Tray with Fittings:Trunking:71598857] storey=Level 0
§TRAY_PATH comp0   reachable_from_A=2134/2134
```
**324.71 m of cable to travel 41.06 m of straight-line distance — a tortuosity of 7.91×.** That single
number is the business case for this lane: nobody estimates a 7.9× detour factor by eye off a drawing,
and getting it wrong is the difference between a drum of cable that reaches and one that does not.

Three more named real pairs in the same component (all fully reachable, no bridging):

| from | to | straight-line | **pull length** | tortuosity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `…Trunking:93688505` | `…Trunking:73853020` | 100.17 m | **169.20 m** | 1.69× |
| `…Trunking:50355079` | `…Trunking:116716247` | 91.94 m | **137.76 m** | 1.50× |
| `…Cable Tray:117484455` | `…Trunking:50349760` | 94.14 m | **184.12 m** | 1.96× |

Other components (each internally 100% reachable): `comp1` n=667, diameter **141.00 m** over 140 hops
(straight 50.43 m, 2.80×); `comp2` n=458, diameter **218.65 m** over 168 hops (straight 70.28 m, 3.11×).

### Cross-component: honestly UNREACHABLE
```
§TRAY_PATH cross_component_reach: from comp0 node, reachable=2134 ; comp1 node in reach=False
§TRAY_PATH components_spanning_multiple_storeys=154/1945
```
A query between two islands must return **UNREACHABLE with the island ids**, never a number. 154
components do genuinely span storeys (real risers exist and are modelled) — so vertical routing needs
no stair-style inference, which is why room-graph E3 must not be copied.

For reference, the best *fallback* graph (authored ∪ RULE_C) reaches a single 11,981-element component
spanning 103.2 × 93.7 × 18.9 m across all six main storeys, whose diameter is a **401.30 m** pull over
209 hops (`Cable Tray:116791876` @ Level 0 → `Trunking:98393118` @ COOLING TOWER, straight 87.57 m,
4.58×). Useful as an upper bound; **not** to be presented as measured truth, since ~6.5% of RULE_C's
edges are false.

## §SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE — `element_transforms.center_*` is the placement ORIGIN, not the element

This is the most consequential incidental finding, and it invalidates a step written into §OPEN 3 itself.

```
§TRAY_GEO transform_source=[('ifc_extract',21009)]
§TRAY_GEO |et.center - rtree.center| n=21009 p50=11.3127 p95=63.3970 max=86.4332 exact_zero=0
§TRAY_GEO rtree_extent_X p50=0.200 p95=2.408 max=55.528   (elements are SMALL; the offset is not a half-length)
```
Cause, read from source not guessed: `extractIFCtoDB.py:1268` sets `center = mat4[:3, 3]` — the
**translation column of the placement matrix**. The AABB (`elements_rtree`, line 1437) is computed
separately from the rotated local vertices. For Revit-exported MEP whose family geometry is authored in
project coordinates, the two are unrelated. Both get the same `§NORMALIZE` offset (lines 1555-1566), so
this is not a normalisation bug — it is what the column *means*.

Fleet-wide, not KUL-specific:
```
§TRAY_CTR KUL_CONTAINMENT_extracted.db n=21009 p50=11.3127 p95=63.3970 max=86.4332 over1m=11536
§TRAY_CTR KUL_EQUIPMENT_extracted.db   n=292   p50=1.1425  p95=3.8556  max=15.7231 over1m=167
§TRAY_CTR Duplex_mep_extracted.db      n=1169  p50=0.0967  p95=3.6400  max=18.0301 over1m=248
```
(`Terminal_extracted.db` / `Duplex_extracted.db` under `deploy/buildings/` predate `elements_rtree` and
could not be checked this way.)

### This already breaks the existing MEP router, measurably
`build/disc_walker.js:routeChains` → `_loadXYZ` / `_loadXYZB` read
`element_transforms.center_x/y/z` (+ `bbox_*`) and nn-pair each fitting to its nearest segment. Scored
against the authored oracle on KUL_CONTAINMENT — the first time `routeChains`' strategy has had a
recorded-topology oracle at all:
```
§TRAY_NN pos=et    face=0 bound=1.0m paired=2    noNbr=9566 precision_vs_authored=0.00% edge_recall=0.00%
§TRAY_NN pos=et    face=1 bound=3.0m paired=657  noNbr=8911 precision_vs_authored=0.00% edge_recall=0.00%
§TRAY_NN pos=rtree face=0 bound=1.0m paired=9063 noNbr=505  precision_vs_authored=78.89% edge_recall=37.35%
§TRAY_NN pos=rtree face=1 bound=1.0m paired=9525 noNbr=43   precision_vs_authored=90.07% edge_recall=44.82%
```
**With the column it actually reads, the engine pairs 2 of 9,568 fittings and gets 0.00% precision. With
`elements_rtree` centres and its own `_nnPassFace` line-distance mode it gets 90.07%.** Same algorithm,
same building — the only variable is the position substrate. `routeChains` is not broken; it is being
fed a column that does not mean what it is used for. (Its `§FACE` mode, `_segLine`/`_ptSeg`/`_perpHalf`,
is the right idea and earns +11 points of precision — keep it.)

Also note the structural ceiling: nn gives **one** leg per fitting, so edge recall plateaus at ~45%
however good the positions are. `witness_walkback_mep.js` already documents this honestly as a
"junction-degree coverage" gap. A tray graph needs *all* legs — the measured degree profile is
`[[1,518],[2,7892],[3,992],[4,37]]` — so an all-pairs rule (RULE_C) or the ports, not nn.

**Scope note:** this section is a finding, not a change. No fix applied to `extractIFCtoDB.py`,
`disc_walker.js`, or any consumer. Whether other `element_transforms.center` consumers are affected is
**unknown** — not surveyed here (see §THREE_WAY (c)).

## §ANSWER — what the BIM engineer most likely meant, in plain language

He is almost certainly talking about **#1, cable pull lengths and routing through the containment**, and
he is right that the big tools do not do it. Ranked by what the measurements support:

1. **Cable pull lengths / which route a cable takes through the tray.** (I) Revit's electrical circuits
   are *logical* — a panel-to-load relationship with no physical path through containment; the tray
   model and the circuit model are separate universes in the same file. (M) So the question "how many
   metres, following the trays" is a shortest-path problem, and this building's answer is **324.71 m
   between two elements 41.06 m apart** — a **7.91×** factor no one eyeballs. (M) 22.4 km of centreline
   and **3,891 authored dead ends** (drop/termination candidates) is a spreadsheet nobody wants to keep
   by hand. This is where his manual work goes.
2. **Auto-routing the tray itself.** (I) Revit's *Generate Layout* auto-routes pipe and duct; there is
   no equivalent for cable tray or conduit — every run is drawn by hand. (M) 11,441 segments + 9,568
   fittings, and the model shows the human's fingerprints all over it: he *did* wire up the connectors
   (19,142 of them, 19,139 geometrically exact), and he left **4,903 ports open** and the network in
   **1,486 pieces**. That is what hand-drawn containment looks like.
3. **Tray fill %, power/data segregation, bend radius.** (I) Manual checks. (M) Not measurable from
   this file — CONTAINMENT carries no cables at all, only the containment. Fill% needs a cable schedule
   we do not have.

**The sharpest thing to tell him:** *"your model already contains the answer — you wired 19,142
connectors and we've been throwing them away on import. What you cannot get from Revit, you can get
from your own IFC."* And the honest caveat in the same breath: the network is in 1,486 pieces, so
today it answers "how long within this run", not "panel to rack across the building" — the two ends
must be in the same run, or the missing links have to be closed in the model first.

**Still unconfirmed with him. Ask.** (§OPEN 4)

## §SPEC — what we would build (spec-first; nothing implemented)

**Claim to witness before any code:** *W-TRAY-GRAPH — for a building whose IFC carries
`IfcRelConnectsPorts`, the compiled tray graph reproduces the authored edge set exactly (edge count
equal, set difference empty), reports its component count without bridging, and returns a pull length
in metres for two elements in the same component / `UNREACHABLE` for two in different ones.*

### T1 — persist the ports (the one extractor change, and it is small)
`extractIFCtoDB.py` already declares `port_elements` (:184) and `port_connections` (:192) and never
writes them. Fill them: walk `IfcRelConnectsPortToElement` → `port_elements(port_guid, element_guid,
flow_direction, local_x/y/z)`; walk `IfcRelConnectsPorts` → `port_connections(port_a_guid,
port_b_guid)`. `IfcDistributionPort` **stays** in `NON_GEOMETRIC_CLASSES` (it has no mesh — that list is
about geometry, and it is correct); ports are read as *relationships*, on the same footing as
`IfcRelVoidsElement` / `IfcRelFillsElement`, which the extractor already handles. Cost: 43,187 + 19,142
rows for CONTAINMENT. Justified by §GRAPH_MEASURED + §AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED, not by preference.

### T2 — REVERSE the port strip in `strip_ifc_nonessential.py --tier model`
`§KUL004`'s stated ground was *"nothing consumes them"*. After T1 something does. Remove
`'IFCDISTRIBUTIONPORT'`, `'IFCRELCONNECTSPORTTOELEMENT'`, `'IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS'` from the drop set
(the file's own line 80) — or gate them behind a flag. **The §KUL004 losslessness proof stays valid; it
proved losslessness against an extractor that ignored ports, and that premise is what changes.** Cost:
CONTAINMENT's model tier goes from -45.2% to roughly -31.6% (ports were 13.6% of the file). The
`--tier meta` (pset-only) tier is unaffected and remains the safe default for RAM-driven stripping.

### T3 — fix `derive_adjacency` for MEP (the fallback path — most of the fleet ships no ports)
Add RULE_C as an MEP branch of `_face_touch`, provenance `derived:mep-coupling` so it never masquerades
as a face-touch: candidate pairs from the rtree within 30 mm, **require** the class pair to be
segment↔fitting, **require** the AABBs to actually intersect, and **drop** the smallest-|overlap| ≤ tol
test that is currently rejecting 5,011 zero-gap real joints. Measured: F1 74.19 → **95.83**. Do **not**
cap degree (kills 1,029 tees/crosses). Do **not** widen the tolerance — the false positives live in the
existing 30 mm, they are not beyond it.

### T4 — the tray graph artifact + walker
- **Nodes** = `elements_meta` rows whose `ifc_class` ∈ {`IfcFlowSegment`,`IfcFlowFitting`,
  `IfcCableCarrierSegment`,`IfcCableCarrierFitting`}, position = **`elements_rtree` AABB centre**
  (§SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE — never `element_transforms.center`).
- **Edges** = `port_connections ⋈ port_elements` when present; else T3's derived edges; **provenance
  stamped per edge**, and the two are never silently mixed in a reported number.
- **Weight** = Euclidean centre-to-centre in **3D** metres, no penalty multiplier, no XY-only hypot.
- **Artifact** = a compiled, version-stamped table (`tray_graph` + `tray_graph_meta.version` /
  `TRAY_GRAPH_V`), following `navigate_find.js:_ensureRoomsCore`'s staleness pattern (:970-988, stamp
  :1084-1098) so consumers self-heal.
- **Search** = `viewer/navigate_grid.js:graphAStar` (:411-479) unchanged, with a tray-derived
  `template`. Two known adaptations: its heuristic is 2D (`hx,hy` at :462-463) — still **admissible**
  for a 3D metric graph (2D ≤ 3D ≤ path cost), so correctness holds, it is just less informed; and its
  open list is a linear scan, so swap in `room_graph.js:_Heap` (:1158-1161) before running 21k nodes.
  `nearestNode` (:481-489) is 2D and **must** take z for tray picking (risers stack).
- **Islands** = `room_graph.js:fullConnectivity` (:818-861), seeded from **edge endpoints** per its own
  `§NOT-EVERY-NODE-IS-A-VERTEX` lesson. **Report them. Never bridge them.**
- **Refuse honestly** — no `IfcRelConnectsPorts` and no MEP class rows → `traysWritten=0` with a reason,
  exactly as `ensureRooms` refuses a building with no walls/doors. An `UNREACHABLE` answer names both
  island ids and their sizes.
- Oracle for the witness: the authored edge set itself where present, and it must **fail loud if its own
  reference data is empty** (a building with zero `IfcCableCarrier*`/flow rows must not report
  "0 islands, all connected").

### T5 — the deliverable a BIM engineer would actually use
`pullLength(fromGuid, toGuid)` → `{metres, hops, path[], straightLine, tortuosity, provenance}` or
`{unreachable: true, islandA, islandB, sizeA, sizeB}`; plus a per-island report (element count, storeys
spanned, centreline metres, dead-end count) and the dead-end list as termination candidates. That last
one is directly the 3,891 number, and it is the cheapest useful thing in this whole spec.

### Sequencing
T1 → T4 → T5 answers the user's question on KUL with exact data. T3 is the independent, fleet-wide win
(and the only path for models with no ports). T2 must land with T1 or the strip silently re-breaks it.
**§SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE is NOT in this spec** — it is a separate finding affecting existing engines, and
it deserves its own scoped session rather than being smuggled in here.

## §THREE_WAY — measured / industry knowledge / genuinely unknown

**(a) MEASURED here, on these files, this session** — authored graph resolution (43,187 ports, 19,142
edges, zero conflicts); **1,486 / 1,945 components, largest 2,134 = 10.16%**; degree profile
`[[1,3891],[2,15622],[3,999],[4,38]]`; 4,903 dangling ports; 19,139/19,142 zero-gap geometric
confirmation; precision **74.58%** / recall **73.81%** of `rel_adjacency` vs authored, and both root
causes (5,011 zero-gap misses from the smallest-overlap test; 53% transverse + `Segment|Segment`-led
false positives); RULE_A/B/C/E scores up to **F1 95.83**; **22,406.3 m** total centreline; the named
pull lengths (**324.71 m / 41.06 m / 7.91×**, 169.20, 137.76, 184.12, 141.00, 218.65 m);
`element_transforms.center` p50 **11.31 m** off the AABB centre with the source line that causes it
(`:1268`) and the fleet spread; `routeChains`' nn strategy at **0.00%** precision on the column it reads
vs **90.07%** on rtree centres; OVERALL.ifc's 55,561 ports / 24,366 connections; ports absent from
`CONTAINMENT_model.ifc` (grep = 0) confirming §KUL004's strip; and every §REUSE_FROM_ROOMS
file:symbol/line above, spot-checked against source.

**(b) INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE — asserted, NOT measured by us** — Revit's *Generate Layout* auto-routes pipe
and duct but has no cable-tray/conduit equivalent; Revit electrical circuits are logical (panel→load)
and do not path through containment, so pull lengths and tray fill are manual/Excel work; tray fill %,
power/data segregation and bend-radius checks are manual; `Oglaend System` is a cable-ladder
manufacturer and "containment" is electrical-trade shorthand for tray/ladder/basket/trunking/conduit.
**We ran no Revit and read no Autodesk source. Do not upgrade any of these to "measured".**

**(c) GENUINELY UNKNOWN** — (1) **Which of the three the engineer meant** — §OPEN 4, needs him. (2)
**Whether the 1,486 islands are a modelling artifact or physical reality** — some are surely real
(containment genuinely stops), some are surely unwired connectors; nothing in the file distinguishes
them, and no amount of geometry will. (3) **Whether the other `element_transforms.center` consumers are
affected** by §SUBSTRATE_LANDMINE — `routeChains` demonstrably is; every other consumer is unaudited.
(4) **Tray fill / segregation** — CONTAINMENT carries containment only, no cables; unanswerable without
a cable schedule. (5) **Whether EQUIPMENT's 292 elements + their ports connect the tray network to
panels** — the panel-to-rack query needs that join and it was not attempted here (EQUIPMENT is a
separate DB; the merged 87,333-element OVERALL DB exists per §KUL012, and its port tables must be empty
too since `grep -rn 'INSERT.*port_elements\|INSERT.*port_connections'` across the whole repo returns
**zero** write sites — that is a *code* measurement, though, not a `SELECT COUNT(*)` on that particular
DB, which was not completed). (6) **RULE_C's transferability** — it is tuned and scored on ONE building;
whether F1 ~96 holds on Terminal/Duplex MEP is untested.


## §CONFIRMED_SCOPE — the engineer confirmed all three (2026-07-30)
The user relayed it plainly: *"The engineer says your 3 issues are true."* So §WHAT_REVIT_CANNOT_DO is
not a ranked guess any more — **pull lengths, tray auto-routing, and fill/segregation are all real,
all manual today.** Three consequences, and one of them is a warning.

**1. The scope is wider than §SPEC assumes, but the SUBSTRATE is the same for all three.**
Every one of the three needs the same thing first: **the authored port graph, persisted** (T1) — or,
for the fleet-wide case with no ports, **a working geometric adjacency rule** (T3). Pull lengths need
it to traverse; fill needs it to know which cables share a segment; auto-routing needs it to know what
connects to what. **T1 + T3 do not get bigger because the scope did.** Build them once.

**2. The 1,486-component finding now bites harder, not less.** With only pull-lengths in scope, a
fragmented graph merely limits the answer to within-run. With auto-routing in scope, those 1,486
islands and 3,891 dead ends are *exactly the defects the engineer would want flagged* — a tray run
that terminates in mid-air is a modelling error or a genuinely unrouted leg, and today nothing tells
him which. **The cheapest real deliverable on this whole page is the dead-end / disconnected-island
report (T5's 3,891 number). Ship that before anything clever.**

**3. ⚠ Do NOT read "all three are true" as "build all three."** Confirmation of a pain point is not a
prioritisation, and the user has not asked for an implementation. What it authorises is treating the
substrate work (T1/T2/T3) as justified rather than speculative. Fill % in particular needs data that
**does not exist in any file we hold** — there is no cable schedule (§THREE_WAY lists it as unknown),
so #3 cannot be built from KUL070 alone no matter how confirmed the need is. **Ask what he has for
cables before promising anything on fill.**

### The one thing still worth asking him
Not "which of the three" — that is settled. Ask instead: **are the 1,486 disconnected components real,
or modelling artifacts?** Nothing in the IFC distinguishes them (§THREE_WAY), and the answer decides
whether T4's router should bridge gaps under a tolerance or refuse them outright. It is the difference
between a useful tool and one that invents connections — which the PRIME RULE forbids.

## §PRIORITY — the engineer said **#2 FIRST**, and a cable schedule is coming (2026-07-30)
Relayed by the user: *"He said #2 first and cable schedule is a coming shortly."*

**My §ANSWER prediction was wrong on priority.** I argued #1 (pull lengths) was the likely meaning
because it is the clean graph problem. He wants **#2 — auto-routing the tray itself**. Correcting the
record here rather than leaving the prediction standing; the *measurements* in §GRAPH_MEASURED,
§AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED and §PULL_LENGTHS are unaffected, only the ranking was.

### Why #2 is a different KIND of problem — read this before speccing it
#1 and #3 are ANALYSIS: traverse or tally something already in the model. **#2 is GENERATIVE** — it
produces tray runs that do not exist yet. That collides directly with the PRIME RULE (*EXTRACT OR
COMPILE ONLY. Never invent*), so the framing has to be right from the start:

**Auto-routing is COMPILING, not inventing — but only if every rule it obeys was MINED, not guessed.**
That is this project's existing doctrine (`project_hba_compile_not_model.md`, and `room_walker`
compiling rooms deterministically from walls). A generated route must carry
`provenance='compiled:…'` and be presented as a **proposal**, never as extracted truth.

### The rule substrate ALREADY EXISTS — and it is measured, not invented
`build/terminal_rules.db` (mined by the RosettaStone gate runs, provenance on every row):

| table | rows | what it holds | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rule_routing` | 11 | per-discipline joint gaps | `PLB IfcPipeFitting→IfcPipeSegment nn avg_gap_m=0.123 min=0.014 max=0.88 n_measured=200 provenance=measured:terminal/nn-chain` |
| `rule_avoidance` | 10 | inter-discipline min clearance + who yields | `ACMV|ELEC min_clear_m=0.453 yields=ELEC n_measured=2403 provenance=measured:terminal/global-p05` |
| `rule_connector` | 2 | connector face/type/standoff | `ELEC IfcLightFixture LIGHT TOP SUPPLY_IN 20mm → ELEC_CONDUIT` |
| `rule_joint_piece` | 6 | fitting dimensions per class | `ACMV IfcDuctFitting DUCT_FITTING 347.5mm × 825mm n_measured=410` |

**⚠ The gap that matters: there is NO cable-tray/containment rule in there.** Those rows are mined from
Terminal (ACMV/PLB/ELEC/FP conduit) — nothing for ladder/tray. So #2 on KUL cannot run off today's
rules DB.

### The loop that closes — and it is the whole point
**The engineer's own 19,142 hand-authored connections ARE the training data.** Mine `rule_routing` /
`rule_joint_piece` for ELEC containment from CONTAINMENT.ifc's authored port graph, then replay those
patterns to route. The survey already measured the rows that would be written: real joints are
**97.8% `Segment|Fitting` at p50 gap 0.49 mm** (§AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED). That is a `rule_routing` row
waiting to exist, with `n_measured=19142` and provenance `measured:KUL070/authored-ports`.

So he hand-built the tray once; we extract HIS pattern and replay it. Nothing invented — his geometry,
his gaps, his fitting choices. **This makes T1 (persist the ports) a hard prerequisite for #2, not just
for #1.** Without ports there is no pattern to mine.

### Revised sequencing
1. **T1 persist ports** + **T2 stop stripping them** — now the prerequisite for the engineer's OWN
   priority, not a nice-to-have.
2. **Mine ELEC-containment rules** from the authored graph into `rule_routing`/`rule_joint_piece`
   (new: `measured:KUL070/authored-ports`). This is the RosettaStone pattern applied to a discipline
   it has never covered.
3. **T5 dead-end / island report** — still ship this first if anything ships early. 3,891 dead ends and
   1,486 components are defects he is currently finding by eye, and it needs no routing engine at all.
4. **Route** = A* over free space, obeying mined clearances (`rule_avoidance`) and replaying mined
   joints. Output labelled a proposal.
5. **Where it lands is the Modeller, NOT the Viewer** — routing WRITES geometry. That is
   `kernel_ops` / authoring territory. Do not bolt a generator into the read-only viewer path.

### Cable schedule incoming → #3 becomes real
Fill/segregation was blocked on data we do not hold (§THREE_WAY). **A schedule is coming shortly**, so:
do NOT build #3 now, but do NOT design it out either — the persisted port graph (T1) is the natural
place to hang a cable→segment assignment. **When it arrives, first question: does it name tray
segments/routes, or only from-panel/to-load?** If the latter, #3 still needs #1's pathfinding to infer
which segments a cable traverses — which is why T1 serves all three.

## §PATH_THEN_PLACE — the decomposition (user, 2026-07-30). **This is the architecture. Follow it.**
User: *"yes it belongs to the modeller.. but pathing is, so what if we just calculate pathing first,
then placement later?"*

**Adopt this.** It splits #2 at exactly the right seam and resolves the PRIME RULE tension that
§PRIORITY flagged — because the two halves have genuinely different natures:

| | PATHING | PLACEMENT |
|---|---|---|
| output | a polyline + cost, in metres | tray segments + fittings, real geometry |
| writes anything? | **NO — pure computation** | yes, authored objects |
| PRIME RULE | not generative at all; a derived measurement | generative — needs mined rules + `provenance='compiled:…'` |
| lives in | read-only analysis (Viewer / CLI) | **Modeller / `kernel_ops`** |
| verifiable by | numbers: length, clearance, bend count — asserted programmatically | needs the full authoring + undo + op-log path |
| blocked on | nothing beyond T1 | mined containment rules that DO NOT EXIST yet (§PRIORITY) |

**The payoff: pathing is deliverable NOW and placement is not.** Placement needs cable-tray
`rule_routing`/`rule_joint_piece` rows that no rules DB currently holds. Pathing needs none of them.

### Why pathing is the right shared primitive — it serves ALL THREE confirmed issues
- **#1 pull lengths** = path length over the tray graph that **already exists**
- **#2 auto-routing** = path over **free space** → hand that polyline to placement later
- **#3 fill/segregation** = *which segments a cable traverses* — that is a path, and it is how a
  from/to-only cable schedule gets turned into per-segment occupancy

**One engine, two graph sources, three consumers.** Build the engine once.

### ⚠ The two graphs are DIFFERENT — same A*, do not conflate them
| | #1 / #3 | #2 |
|---|---|---|
| nodes | existing tray segments/fittings | free-space cells / waypoints |
| edges | authored `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS` (19,142) | clear moves between voids |
| cost | real centreline length | length + bend penalty + clearance violation |
| may it bridge a gap? | **NO** — return UNREACHABLE (1,486 components are real, §GRAPH_MEASURED) | yes, that is its job — free space is meant to be traversed |

Getting this backwards is the failure mode: a #1 query that bridges gaps invents cable that cannot be
pulled; a #2 route that refuses gaps can never route anything.

### Shared with the fly-tour lane — do not build the free-space graph twice
#2's free-space graph is **the same problem** as `FLY_TOUR_CORRIDOR_GRAPH.md` §MEP_ONLY_FREE_FLY /
§MOF-2 ("regard spaces as arbitrary corridors"), and it hits the same measured wall recorded there:
`common/storey_raster.js` + `scripts/build_storey_walkable_raster.js` exist, but the builder takes its
extent from `ifc_class LIKE 'IfcSlab%'` and **KUL070 has 1 slab**; and AABB-as-obstacle over-blocks
badly because a tray's AABB dwarfs the tray. **Measure walkable fraction per storey BEFORE committing
to AABB occupancy — one measurement decides both lanes.** If it comes out near zero, both need real
mesh occupancy, not boxes.

### Order of work, revised
1. **T1 persist ports** — unblocks everything, still the one prerequisite.
2. **Pathing engine over the AUTHORED graph** (#1) — deliverable, numerically witnessable
   (`§TRAY_PATH` already proves the maths: 324.71 m / 249 hops / tortuosity 7.91), refuses across
   components. **Ship this.**
3. **T5 dead-end / island report** — 3,891 dead ends, 1,486 components; needs no engine, and it is
   what makes the graph trustworthy enough to route on.
4. **Walkable-fraction measurement** — one number, serves both this lane and §MOF-2.
5. **Free-space pathing** (#2 half one) — still read-only, still just a polyline.
6. **Placement** (#2 half two) — Modeller, after containment rules are mined. **Not before.**

Cable schedule: not yet on this machine (checked `~/Downloads` 2026-07-30 — no `*cable*`/`*master*`
match). When it lands, see §PRIORITY's question: does it name tray segments, or only from/to?

## §CABLE_SCHEDULE — it arrived, and it answers §PRIORITY's question (2026-07-30)
`Master Cable List 30.06.2026.xlsx`, 3.0 MB, 17 sheets. Copied to
`~/bim-ootb/IFC/KUL/` (private, local-only — covered by `origin/main`'s `.gitignore:72 IFC/KUL/*`).
Read-only inspection via `openpyxl`; nothing modified.

### The answer: **FROM/TO ONLY — no tray segments named.**
`MV CABLE SCHEDULE` / `LV CABLE SCHEDULE` header row (r4):
`From | Location | To | Location | Cable Specification | … | Cable Lth | Cutting Lth (m) | No. of Cable | Status Cable Contain | Status Cable Cutting | Start/End Date`

So §PRIORITY's question is settled the harder way: **#3 (fill/segregation) CANNOT be done from this
file alone — it needs pathing to infer which tray segments each cable traverses.** Confirms
§PATH_THEN_PLACE: pathing is the shared primitive, and #3 is downstream of it.

### ⭐ The most valuable thing in the file: HAND-COMPUTED LENGTHS = ground truth
| sheet | runs | runs with a length | total hand-computed |
|---|---|---|---|
| MV CABLE SCHEDULE | 22 | 21 | **1,052 m** |
| LV CABLE SCHEDULE | 306 | 303 | **22,366 m** |

`Cable Lth` is the engineer's own figure per run; `Cutting Lth` is that plus slack (e.g. HVSS→MV-A:
`Cable Lth 168.0`, `Cutting Lth 175.0`). **This is #1 (pull lengths) caught in the act being done by
hand — 324 runs of it.** It also hands us a real WITNESS rather than an assertion:

> **W-PULL-LENGTH-VS-ENGINEER** — path `HVSS → MV-A` over the authored tray graph and compare against
> his 168.0 m. Then `HVSS → MV-B` (146.0 m), `MV-A → RMU-HS` (64.0 m). Agreement within a stated
> tolerance validates the engine against the human; disagreement is a finding either way. **Do not
> ship a pathing engine without running this — the answer key already exists.**

### ⚠ A coincidence to NOT build on
LV hand-computed total **22,366 m** vs §PULL_LENGTHS' measured total tray centreline **22,406.3 m** —
within **0.18%**. Striking, and **probably coincidence**: in a datacentre a single tray carries many
cables, so total cable length should EXCEED total tray length substantially, not equal it. Flagged
because it will tempt someone. **Per-run comparison (W-PULL-LENGTH-VS-ENGINEER) is the real test;
the aggregate agreeing means nothing on its own.**

### §CS-JOIN — the join problem nobody has solved yet
Endpoints are **equipment/panel names, not GUIDs**: `HVSS`, `MV-A`, `MV-B`, `RMU-HS`, `HSSB`,
`GEN-HS`, `HUPP-XFMR`, `MEDS-XFMR-1.1A…`, `CH-1.1-01`, `CHCOP-1.1A` (MV 21 distinct, LV ~294).
`Location` is a room name: `Site Substation`, `MV Room First Floor`, `Admin Electrical Room E1.1`,
`Electrical Room E1.1/E2.1`, `Catcher Room C1.1/C2.1`.

**To path a cable we must first resolve those names to elements.** Candidate source: `EQUIPMENT.ifc`
(292 elements — the panels/transformers). **Unverified — nobody has checked whether its element names
match this vocabulary.** That is the next cheap measurement, and it gates everything downstream of it.
Note the rooms are also unresolvable today: KUL070 has `IfcSpace=0`, so `Location` has nothing to bind
to either.

### Data hygiene — the LV sheet needs cleaning before use
`LV CABLE SCHEDULE`'s distinct-endpoint set contains numeric junk (`0.2772277228`, `84.0`, `1241`,
`61795`) leaking from merged/spilled cells, so **~294 is inflated** — the true count is lower. Rows are
also double-spaced (data on odd rows). Any parser must handle both. Other sheets present but not yet
read: `MV/LV Cable Drum`, `Material Tracking List`, `List of Equipment`, `Cable lug (by room)` —
`List of Equipment` may be the §CS-JOIN key and is worth reading first.

### Bonus find — a 4D hook nobody asked for
`Status Cable Contain` (containment ready?), `Status Cable Cutting`, `Start Date` / `End Date` with real
progress (`Done (25/4/2026)`, `Ongoing`). **The schedule already tracks containment readiness per cable
run** — i.e. it is a 4D progress feed keyed to the very trays we modelled. Recorded, not pursued.

## §DEFERRED_DECISION — where this surfaces (user, 2026-07-30)
User: *"decide later when put up in Find Panel as a feature or in Modeller when it stablize later in
other session."* **Do NOT decide this now and do NOT let it block the pathing work.** Pathing is
read-only and surface-agnostic (§PATH_THEN_PLACE) — build the engine, defer the UI seam. Revisit only
once pathing is stable, in its own session.

## §CS_JOIN_MEASURED — the join works, and the ceiling is a MISSING MODEL, not a naming problem
Measured 2026-07-30. Closes §CS-JOIN's "unverified".

### The join key: the MIDDLE segment of the Revit `Family:Type:Id` name
`EQUIPMENT.ifc` element names are `Family:Type:Id`, and **the Type segment IS the cable list's tag**:
```
33kV MV-A1 : MV-A : 56715819                                   -> MV-A          ✅ in the schedule
(20260511) C18_Enclosure-6000L_GEN-HS : GEN - HS : 60412595     -> GEN-HS        ✅ (space variant)
```
292 elements, 292 distinct names, 274 distinct Type tags. **The vocabularies are the same one.**

### Match rate, and what each normalisation step buys
| pass | endpoints matched | runs with BOTH ends resolvable |
|---|---|---|
| exact + hyphen-space (`GEN - HS`→`GEN-HS`) | 81 / 300 = **27.0%** | 50 / 325 = 15.4% |
| **+ strip `(…)` suffix, collapse hyphens (`CH-MEDS`→`CHMEDS`), map breaker positions `-BIB/-MIB/-MOB` to parent panel** | **137 / 298 = 46.0%** | **134 / 325 = 41.2%** |

The `-BIB/-MIB/-MOB` suffixes are breaker positions *inside* a panel (e.g. `CHUPP-1.1MA1-MIB` →
`CHUPP-1.1MA1`, which does exist) — resolving them to the parent panel is correct, not a fudge.

### The remaining 54% is MECHANICAL PLANT THAT IS NOT MODELLED — verified, not assumed
161 unmatched endpoints group cleanly by prefix, and they are all mechanical:
`EF` 28 (exhaust fans) · `DAHU` 20 · `MSDB` 18 · `CRAC` 10 · `GPP` 9 · `HTP` 6 · `CH`/`CHWP`/`CT`/`CWP` 4 each.

Searched **both** models for them:

| prefix | in OVERALL_complete | in EQUIPMENT | needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| CRAC | 3 | 0 | 10 |
| MSDB | 3 | 3 | 18 |
| DAHU · EF- · CHWP · CH-1.1 · CT- · CWP · GPP | **0** | **0** | 71 |

**So `EQUIPMENT.ifc` is the ELECTRICAL/genset plant only** (MV switchgear, RMU, GEN, UPS, distribution
panels) — the mechanical plant the LV cables feed is in **no KUL file we hold.** No amount of string
normalisation fixes that.

**⛔ ASK THE BIM PERSON: is there a mechanical-equipment IFC (chillers, CRACs, AHUs, pumps, fans)?**
That single file would take the join from 46% to potentially near-complete. Until it arrives, **41.2%
of runs are pathable end-to-end and that is the honest ceiling** — enough to build and validate the
engine (§CABLE_SCHEDULE's `W-PULL-LENGTH-VS-ENGINEER` needs only `MV-A→RMU-HS` etc., all of which
resolve), not enough to deliver a complete cable-length report.

## §CABLE_SPEC_STD — use standard cable data, per the user (2026-07-30)
User: *"BIM person shall send cable thickness if use but do use std as in practice today as we want to
address general needs."* **So: do NOT wait for KUL-specific diameters, and do NOT invent them.**

### What the schedule already gives — 100% machine-readable
`§CABLE_SPEC rows_with_spec=325 regex_parsed=325 (100.0%) distinct=27`. Format is consistent:
```
4 x 1C 300 MM.SQ CU/XLPE/LSHF + 1 x 1C 150 MM.SQ     (x86, the most common)
1 x 4C 16  MM.SQ CU/XLPE/LSHF + 1 x 1C 16  MM.SQ     (x54)
8 x 4 x 1C 300 MM.SQ CU/XLPE/LSHF + 4 x 1C 300       (x14 — nested sets)
```
Parses to `sets × [group ×] cores × area_mm² + earth`, plus conductor `CU`, insulation `XLPE`, sheath
`LSHF`, voltage class MV/LV. **Every field needed to KEY a standard lookup is already present.**

### What is MISSING and how to get it without inventing
Fill needs **overall diameter (OD)**, which the schedule does not carry. Do it the same way this project
does everything else — a lookup table with provenance, not magic numbers:

```
cable_std(voltage_class, cores, conductor_mm2, insulation, sheath) -> od_mm, weight_kg_per_m
    provenance = 'std:<published source + edition>'      -- e.g. a manufacturer/standard table
```
**Rules, non-negotiable:** every row cites its source in `provenance`; **no row is hand-guessed**; a
missing key returns UNKNOWN and the fill calc **refuses that segment** rather than estimating. This is
the same contract as `rule_routing`'s `provenance=measured:…` — the difference is `std:` (published)
vs `measured:` (mined), and both are traceable.

Fill rule itself is also standard, not ours to invent: cite the tray standard (IEC 61537 / the
manufacturer's load table) for the permitted fill basis, and record WHICH basis a given number used —
single-layer for power vs percentage-area for control/data give different answers and must not be mixed
silently.

**Why this serves "general needs":** keying on (cores, mm², insulation, voltage) rather than on KUL part
numbers means the table works for every project, and KUL-specific diameters — if the BIM person does
send them — become an OVERRIDE layer on top, not a replacement.

## §SLD — Single/One-Line Diagrams landed, and they close the NAMING gap (2026-07-30)
`~/Downloads/KUL070-SWC-SD-E-TRN-1312.3.zip` (17.8 MB) → extracted to `~/bim-ootb/IFC/KUL/SLD/`
(private, under `origin/main`'s `.gitignore IFC/KUL/*`). 9 drawings, DWG + plotted PDF, `.bak` removed:

`E-7000` MV SINGLE LINE · `E-7001` POWER ONE LINE HOUSE LINE UP · `E-7002` CATCHERS ·
`E-7003/7004` 1.1A/1.1B · `E-7015/7016` 2.1A/2.1B · **`E-7020/7021` ONE LINE MECHANICAL 1.1A/1.1B**

**Tooling note:** no DWG converter on this machine (`dwg2dxf`, `ODAFileConverter`, `dwgread` all
missing; `ezdxf` 1.4.3 is present but reads DXF, not DWG). The plotted PDFs are vector, so
`pdftotext -layout` extracts the tags cleanly — **use the PDFs, don't fight the DWGs.**

### The gain — measured against the §CS_JOIN_MEASURED baseline
| tag source | endpoints resolved | runs with BOTH ends resolved |
|---|---|---|
| `EQUIPMENT.ifc` only | 137/298 = 46.0% | 134/325 = 41.2% |
| **SLD only** | 265/298 = 88.9% | 290/325 = 89.2% |
| **EQUIPMENT + SLD** | **273/298 = 91.6%** | **299/325 = 92.0%** |

Every prefix that was missing is present: `DAHU` 20/20 · `EF-` 28/28 · `CHWP` 4/4 · `CH-1.1` 4/4 ·
`HTP` 6/6 · `CRAC` 15 (needed 10) · `MSDB` 23 (18) · `CT-` 6 (4) · `CWP` 5 (4) · `GPP` 11 (9).
The 25 stragglers are mostly free prose in the schedule, not tags — `FIRE HYD PUMP 1`,
`FUEL TRANSFER PUMP A`, plus `GEN-1.1C/2.1B/2.1C`.

### ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** FIX — do not conflate these two ceilings
**The SLD gives IDENTITY and LOGICAL TOPOLOGY. It gives NO GEOMETRY.** A `CRAC-1.1-001` now has a
confirmed tag and a known place in the electrical hierarchy — and still has **no coordinates in any
model we hold.** So:

| capability | ceiling | why |
|---|---|---|
| cable-list validation, from/to completeness, feed-hierarchy checks | **92%** | needs identity only |
| **PATHING / pull lengths** | **still ~41%** | needs a physical position; SLD has none |

**§CS_JOIN_MEASURED's ask still stands: a MECHANICAL-EQUIPMENT IFC is what lifts pathing.** The SLD
lifts everything that is not geometry. Anyone quoting "92%" for pathing has conflated the two.

### The second, unasked-for value: an INDEPENDENT topology to cross-check against
A one-line diagram *is* the logical feed graph — which panel feeds which, through which breaker. The
cable list's `From`/`To` columns are the same graph in tabular form, authored separately. **So they can
be diffed**, and any disagreement is a real finding, not noise:
- a feed on the SLD with no cable in the schedule → **missing cable** (or missing from the schedule)
- a cable in the schedule with no feed on the SLD → **wrong tag, or an undocumented feed**
- ratings/breaker sizes on the SLD vs `Cable Specification` → **sizing cross-check**

That is a deliverable needing **no geometry, no pathing engine and no rules DB** — pure text-vs-table
diff. Cheap, and it audits two documents the engineer maintains by hand. **Candidate for shipping
before anything else on this page**, alongside the §T5 dead-end report.

### Recorded caveat on the extraction
`pdftotext` token-matching is deliberately loose (any `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*([-.][A-Z0-9]+)*` of length ≥3),
so **88.9% "SLD only" is an UPPER BOUND** — some hits may be incidental text on the sheet (legends,
notes, revision blocks), not equipment tags. Before building the diff, parse the SLD properly (block
attributes if a DWG converter is installed, or positional/layout parsing of the PDF) rather than trusting
bag-of-tokens. **The direction of the finding is safe; the exact percentage is not yet.**

## §FIND_PANEL_CABLE — where this surfaces: the Find panel, in the VIEWER (decided 2026-07-30)
**Supersedes §DEFERRED_DECISION.** User: *"putting this in Find Panel room/type/path ← can also switch
to cable path when such data is present in the DB … Later this can mature to a separate feature in
Modeller as this is not Modeller but a IFC handoff to BIM5D in Viewer."*

**The framing is the important part: this is an IFC → BIM5D HANDOFF, read-only, in the Viewer.** It is
NOT Modeller work. Placement/authoring (§PATH_THEN_PLACE's second half) may graduate to the Modeller
later; pathing and everything on this page does not.

### It slots into a control that ALREADY EXISTS — no new UI
`navigate_find.js:3028` — the **Room** facet already carries a sub-toggle
`{ Storey | Type | Path }` (`_roomGroupBy`, `:327`), with `Path` driving `_drawPathHighlight()`
(`:1264`) and `§PATH_ORANGE` highlighting. **Add `Cable` as a fourth value.** Same control, same
highlight machinery, different graph — exactly §PATH_THEN_PLACE's "one engine, two graph sources".

Facet gating is also already the house pattern (`_axes()`, `:830`): *"Storey + Discipline always;
Room/Material/Phase only when their data is present"* via `_probeLenses()`. So **`Cable` is
data-gated the same way** — it joins the `§RULE1 SINGLE TOGGLE` cycle only when the DB carries cable
data. Nothing to invent; follow `present.room` / `present.material` / `present.phase`.

```
present.cable  =  port_connections > 0        (tray topology — needs T1)
                  AND cable_runs > 0          (the schedule, ingested)
```

### The notice when it is absent — the user's exact requirement
Most DBs will never have this, because **the KUL cabling data is local-only and is never shipped to the
server/OCI** (private client data, `.gitignore IFC/KUL/*`). A silently-missing facet reads as a bug, so
instead show, verbatim:

> **Data Centre POC — where the data is local in DB only**

Precedent to copy, not reinvent: the greyed-facet / needle notice already handles "the axis exists but
your DB lacks the data" (`_needleState`, `:788-798`, and `§NEEDLE` in `_renderNeedle()`). Route this
through the same surface. Log `§FIND_CABLE_GATE present=false reason=no-cable-data` so an absent facet
is diagnosable from the console rather than guessed at.

### The feature ladder — what each piece of KUL data unlocks
Ordered by what it costs us, and marked with what it is BLOCKED on. Nothing here is built.

| # | feature in Find | needs | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **SLD ↔ schedule diff** — feed on the one-line with no cable; cable with no feed; breaker rating vs `Cable Specification` | SLD text + xlsx only. **No geometry, no engine, no rules.** | ready to build (§SLD) |
| F2 | **Dead-end / island report** — 3,891 dead ends, 1,486 components | authored port graph (T1) | ready after T1 (§GRAPH_MEASURED) |
| F3 | **Cable path highlight** — pick two endpoints, light the tray route in `§PATH_ORANGE` | T1 + §CS-JOIN name→element | **41% of runs** (geometry ceiling, §SLD) |
| F4 | **Pull length readout** — metres along the route, vs the engineer's own figure | F3 | answer key exists: `W-PULL-LENGTH-VS-ENGINEER` |
| F5 | **Tray fill / segregation** — % occupancy per segment, power-vs-data | F3 + `cable_std` OD (§CABLE_SPEC_STD) | needs published OD table |
| F6 | **4D containment progress** — colour trays by `Status Cable Contain` + dates | schedule ingest only | free rider on F1 (§CABLE_SCHEDULE) |
| F7 | **Auto-route proposal** — the engineer's #1 priority | free-space graph + MINED containment rules | **Modeller**, not here (§PRIORITY) |

**F1, F2 and F6 need no pathing engine at all.** If anything ships first, it is those three — they are
the cheapest, they audit documents the engineer keeps by hand, and F6 turns a spreadsheet column into
BIM5D colour with no new maths.

### Two guardrails for whoever builds it
- **F3/F4 must return UNREACHABLE across the 1,486 components** (§PATH_THEN_PLACE). A path that bridges
  a gap invents cable that cannot be pulled — the PRIME RULE forbids it, and the engineer would be the
  one who discovers it on site.
- **Never quote 92% for pathing.** That is the *naming* ceiling from the SLD; the *geometry* ceiling is
  ~41% until a mechanical-equipment IFC arrives (§SLD).

## §RUN_READY — ⚠ THE REAL CEILING IS ~7%, NOT 41%. Attachment is fine; the GRAPH is too broken.
Measured 2026-07-30, `scratchpad/check_134.py`. **This supersedes the "41% pathable" figure used in
§SLD and §FIND_PANEL_CABLE for F3/F4 — 41% was the NAME-resolution ceiling, not the traversal ceiling.**

Graph rebuilt independently from CONTAINMENT.ifc and it reproduces the survey exactly — good
cross-validation of both passes:
```
§G nodes=20550 edges=19142 components=1486 largest=2134
```
⚠ Parse gotcha that cost a run: in `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTS('guid',#ownerHist,'name','Flow',#PortA,#PortB,$)`
and `IFCRELCONNECTSPORTTOELEMENT(…,#RelatingPort,#RelatedElement)` the **FIRST `#` is the owner-history
ref, not a port.** Take `ids[1]`/`ids[2]`, never `ids[0]`.

### The two numbers that matter
```
§RUN_READY  runs with both ends positioned            = 119
§RUN_READY  …of those, both ends on the SAME component =   8  (6.7%)
§ATTACH_GAP panel -> nearest tray  median=1.14m  p90=2.15m  max=10.79m  under_2m=87%
```
**Attachment is NOT the problem** — 87% of panels sit within 2 m of a tray, median 1.14 m. Panels are
where they should be. **Traversal is the problem: 93% of otherwise-ready runs cannot be walked**
because their two ends sit on different disconnected pieces of the tray graph.

### His own numbers PROVE the graph is under-connected, not the building
```
from        to          HIS length   compA  compB  same?
RMU-1.1A -> RMU-1.1B      10.0 m      c5     c1     NO
RMU-1.1B -> RMU-1.1C      38.0 m      c1     c711   NO
MV-A     -> RMU-HS        64.0 m      c52    c1     NO
```
Two panels **10 m apart**, with a cable he has already measured and installed — and the model says
there is no connected tray between them. **A physical route demonstrably exists.** So the 1,486
components are overwhelmingly *missing couplings in the model*, not separate physical runs.

**This flips §CONFIRMED_SCOPE's open question from "worth asking" to ANSWERED BY EVIDENCE**: the islands
are artifacts. It does NOT license bridging arbitrary gaps — it licenses *fixing the edge rule*, which
is a different and legitimate thing.

### So the fix is the ADJACENCY RULE, and the survey already found it
§AUTHORED_VS_DERIVED measured a corrected geometric rule at **F1 95.83 vs the shipped 74.19**, and
`RULE_A` at **99.99% recall**. The authored 19,142 ports are the *skeleton*; a corrected face/overlap
rule supplies the couplings the export never wrote. **Union of the two is what makes the network
traversable — neither alone does it.**

**The measurement that decides the feature (do this before building anything):** rebuild the graph as
`authored ports ∪ corrected-geometric edges`, then re-run `§RUN_READY`. If same-component rises from 8
toward 119, F3/F4 are viable. If it stays low, cable pathing on this model is not deliverable and we
should say so plainly rather than ship a 7% tool.

**Do not quote 41% for pathing again.** 41% = names resolve. 6.7% = a path exists today.
