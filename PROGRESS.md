# PROGRESS — Current Development State

> **Rule:** PROGRESS.md is a thin status file. No specs here — specs live in `docs/` and `prompts/`. Keep this file under 80 lines.

## Current State

**Gate:** `./scripts/run_RosettaStones.sh` — S190 fleet: 116/157 PASS, 4 ALL GREEN (BR,MO,RL,WI). 21 buildings. 9-gate system.

| PFX | EL | GATES | Notes |
|-----|----|-------|-------|
| BR | 33 | 9/9 | ALL GREEN |
| MO | 2791 | 9/9 | ALL GREEN |
| RL | 1 | 9/9 | ALL GREEN |
| WI | 1 | 9/9 | ALL GREEN |
| DX | 1169 | 8/9 | MetadataMissing (IfcOpeningElement) |
| SH | 65 | 8/9 | MetadataMissing (generative MEP) |
| TE | 48428 | 8/10 | C8 mesh diversity, GEO no pairs (federated) |

**Pipeline:** 11 stages. 77 verbs. 7403 products (ERP.db). 4-DB architecture.

## OPEN — real work, not yet done (check these before starting a new session)

### 🔀 CURRENTLY JUGGLED (user runs these concurrently across terminals, shuts down/resumes cold — read this
### list FIRST, don't ask the user to restate status, it's kept current here)
- `prompts/RESUME_HR_BIM_ASSET.md` §2026-07-06c — camera-POV done (#674 `77f41b9`). Open: A/B/C bugs + E decision.
- `prompts/RESUME_WORLD_HISTORY_DEDUP_RESTORE.md` §2026-07-06 — Viewer Part2 done (#670 `d6bfb80`); Modeller
  port Ph1-2 done (#675 `9ff9a5a`+`6d9f906a`), open: G6, Ph3. World-History Part1 parked.
- `prompts/PILL_DRAWER_REORGANIZATION.md` §2026-07-06 — done (#673 `953d1e4`). Open: first-touch flicker.
- `prompts/OPEN_BUTTON_IFC_BCF_MERGE.md` — not started.
- `prompts/Modeller/DISC_Walker/RESUME_DISC_WALKER_ENVELOPE_BOUND.md` — 2026-07-10 marathon: 6 branches built,
  independently re-verified (3 caught false-green reports, see memory), and pushed — schedule-walk DEFAULT-FLIP
  + LOD400 meshes (`fable/meshdb-livewire`/`fable/modeller-lod400-livewire`), grid rotation-guard extended to
  X/Y-tilt + the Modeller's real y-axis (`fix/grid-tilt-guard`), rot-units radians/degrees bug
  (`fix/dw-rot-units`), `__dwPixelProbe` dedup + harness fixes (`fable/dwprobe-dedup`), Terminal MEP-oracle
  stale-path fix (`fix/terminal-oracle-source`). **NONE merged to main yet** — that's the next gate before any
  "UI is screenshot-ready for the user guide" claim holds. SampleCastle rooms: CLOSED, not a gap (disc_walker
  needs none, works via `duplex_rules.db`+`substrate()`). Open: Terminal PLB walk untested (in progress),
  old op-log rot-units data unmigrated (unsafe to blind-fix), `cat[0]` legacy fallback, W5 RSS-exact ratchet.
  Full detail: `project_disc_walker_grid_guard_marathon_2026-07-10.md` (memory).

### Other open work (lower/no current juggling priority)
- **HBA IoT "wow" batch** (bim-ootb PR #659 shipped item 4b) — items 1/2/0 (CCTV double-click capture, camera-POV
  fly-to ⛔ needs human-declared facing vector, mobile card-stack redesign) not yet built. Full detail + phased
  build order: `prompts/RESUME_HBA_MOBILE_CARD_STACK.md` (bim-ootb) + memory `project_hba_iot_lod400_lane.md`.
- **Held, not yet built (user's own call — prove smallest piece first):** Modeller prefab design dialogue —
  DAG-guided lasso, escalating selection, macro-capture — `prompts/PREFAB_LASSO_MACRO_LIBRARY_DIALOGUE.md`.
- **Spec ready, not built:** `prompts/UBBL_RULES_GATE.md` (room area/height vs. 2 verified By-Law thresholds).
- **Kernel op-log T4+T5** (unify 3 kernel copies) — BROWSER-GATED, needs W-ONE-KERNEL building-load smoke.
  Deferred: `commitGroup` id-race retry. Spec: `prompts/KERNEL_HARDENING_BATCH1_SPEC.md §STATUS`.
- **Modeller onboarding** — Hospital/Clinic/LTU/HHS_Office as Modeller residents + migrate SH/DX/SC into the
  canonical `IFC/` folder. Spec: `prompts/ARC_GEO_FETCH_SPEC.md §NEXT` item 2.
- ⛔ BLOCKED (user call): are `migration/DV_*_rules.sql` mined-rule files EXEMPT from append-only, or enforce?
  Full triage: `prompts/CODEBASE_QUALITY_AUDIT_2026-07-02.md §TRIAGE` (§1 refactors, §3 shallow specs also open).
- Modeller unassigned polish: item 9 PBR textures; SSAO (needs EffectComposer vendored).
- ARC occupancy density drift (99%→92-95%, `W-DW-DENSITY-TE` D3) surfaced by PR #638 below — real, unexplained,
  low-priority, not urgent. Memory: `project_arc_meshreadpixels_branch_unmerged.md`.

## Archive — DONE/shipped (one-line pointers; detail in cards + memory topic files)
- **✅ pending merge only:** `prompts/SCALE_AND_UX_SWEEP.md` (bim-ootb PR #665) — Terminal-scale checks + 6 UX/audit
  fixes, independently re-verified. `OFFLINE_GITHUB_RELEASE_BUNDLE.md` (bim-ootb `lane/offline-gateway-leak-fix`,
  `cd36c07`) — cache-leak fix, independently verified live. Both just need the human merge action.
- **2026-07-05 arc: landing Save/Open+multimerge resurrect+versioning, grid green/orange, Save/auto-heal,
  Teams E2E, HBA mobile stack, UBBL+parametric recon** — bim-ootb #654/#656/#657/#658/#660/#661/#662/#664, ALL
  MERGED, watchdog-verified against real diffs (not trust-on-recap — caught 1 false "already fixed" fixture
  claim, corrected). Full detail: `prompts/FRONTEND_LANE_MASTER.md §NEW BACKLOG` + `prompts/
  GRID_PREDRAG_PREVIEW_SAVE_COMPLETEIT.md` (design dialogue) + memory `project_teams_e2e_no_ui_finding.md` /
  `project_ubbl_recon_landmine.md`.

## OCI Deployment

- Live: `bim-ootb-live` (SYSNOVA landing + viewer + single DBs). Always upload here.
- Single DB per building: `buildings/{Name}_extracted.db` (metadata + geometry + bbox).
- `deploy/sandbox/` stale (last ~S225) — not used for deploy. `deploy/dev/` is canonical.
- Deploy SOP: `deploy/OCI_UPLOAD.md`
