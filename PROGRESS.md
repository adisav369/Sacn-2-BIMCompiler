## Session 2026-08-15 (continued) — §GANTT_WINDOW_FIDELITY_AND_SPREAD: real regression found+fixed
User: "correlating exactly to TM Gantt timeline? spread evenly within each bar?" Q1: re-measured
§OG_HANG_BAND (#1375) per building (not just Hospital) — clean on 5/7, but real on LTU_AHouse
(window violations 16→526, overshoot up to **79.1 days**) and Duplex (52→199, sub-day). Root cause:
`_ogSupportSweep` had no task-window awareness at all. **Fixed, bim-ootb PR #1376, MERGED**: the
hang-repair (not bearing) now refuses a push that would exit the target's own Gantt task window —
element stays honestly floating instead. Measured all 7: +117 floating (3063→3180, +3.8%) for max
overshoot everywhere dropping to ≤0.78d (was up to 79d). `_GANTT_CACHE_VERSION` 22→23. Q2: traced
"not spread evenly" to one exact mechanism (Hospital TASK_Architecture_Level_4: 4350 elements split
1571@day0-12 / 0@day13-132 / 2779@day133-135) — `phaseTrade[storey][seq]` cross-discipline trade
gate in `schedule_gate.js`, confirmed DELIBERATE documented design (§4D_BAND_MONOTONIC header), not
a bug — ruled OUT as a fix target, not attempted. Likely same root as the already-named
`§TIER2_AFTER_TIER1` dead-air item, now much more precisely characterized. Full trail:
`prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` §GANTT_WINDOW_FIDELITY_AND_SPREAD.

## Session 2026-08-15 (session close) — 4 real bugs shipped, 1 real gap named+bounded, not solved
bim-ootb PRs #1364 (`_cap` shadowing crash), #1365 (revert #1364's scale-mismatched bolt-on),
#1368 (§GANTT_TASK_WINDOW_FIDELITY — elements now placed within their own Gantt task's authored
window, not a global rescale), #1372 (§XRAY_STAGING_REMOVED — nothing shows before its support
finishes, ghosted or solid). All verified via real fresh-browser probes, not screenshots.
**§OG_HANG_BAND — FOUND, FIXED, SHIPPED (bim-ootb PR #1375):** the 1510-float root cause was
`_ogSupportSweep`'s hang-repair reusing the 0.5m bearing tolerance as its search radius, far tighter
than what the judge already accepts as real (measured real gaps: p50=2.00m, 812/821 within 9.5m —
reused the already-cited `§HANG_NEAREST` band, not a new guess). Widened to 9.5m. All 7 buildings:
4339→3063 floating (-29%), Hospital 1581→611 (-61%), proxy class 1012→55 (-95%). The earlier
"reclassify IfcBuildingElementProxy's phase" hypothesis (previous entry below) was checked against
real geometry and DISPROVEN first (only 9/5729 touch MEP-only carriers). A 3rd repair-layer lever
(fixpoint repair before window computation) was also tried and ruled out (1581→2406, worse).
Residual 3063 named, dominant class now `IfcFooting` (unmoved, different relation, unexplored).
`_GANTT_CACHE_VERSION` 21→22, `sw.js` v1031→v1032. Full trail: `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md`
§OG_HANG_BAND.
**Scoped then SHIPPED** (2026-08-15): `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` §TIME_MACHINE_CONSOLIDATION_SPEC
scoped the 9,016-line file (158 commits, 7 separable concerns). §SCHEDULE_CLASSIFY_DEDUP implemented
the recommended first step — bim-ootb PR #1374 (OPEN): collapsed `time_machine.js`'s 2 duplicate
`matchRule`/`matchNameOverride` closures into one shared pair delegating to `schedule_author.js`'s
canonical, already-exported versions. Narrower than the spec's literal "new file, ~150-250 lines"
ask — `assignStoreyByZ`/`getInstallSecs` turned out NOT to be real 3-way duplicates on closer read
(already shared/delegating) — so zero edits to `schedule_author.js`, no conflict surface against the
parallel floating-MEP PR. Verified zero behavior change: `witness_class_fallback_blackbox.js`
rewritten, 321,509 elements/8 buildings/0 disagreements; 5 other slice-based witnesses updated,
numbers byte-identical to `main`; `scripts/gate_4d.sh` pass=7 fail=0. Full concern-based split
(LARGE, 17+ files) still deferred until this file's churn settles.

## Session 2026-08-15 (continued) — §HOSPITAL_LIGHTING_STILL_FLOATING FOUND+FIXED+SHIPPED, bim-ootb PR #1364
Real root cause, not the ones chased below: `injectGantt()` had a `var _cap` name collision — a
crew-demand loop's local number silently clobbered the captured-native-schedule descriptor object of
the same name, crashing that overlay's application on EVERY run (caught+swallowed by injectGantt's
own `.catch`, confirmed live in the user's own v1029 production console, same crash signature).
Fixing it exposed a second real gap: `_ogSupportSweep` (the captured path's own repair) has a
narrower carrier pool than `_contactGraph`'s (#1338-broadened) — 11/1523 lighting/electrical elements
floated the FIRST time that path ever actually ran. Closed by running `_midairRepair` as a final pass
after it. Re-measured 0/1523 floating, real fresh-browser probe, twice. `_GANTT_CACHE_VERSION` 19→20.
Full trail: `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` §HOSPITAL_LIGHTING_STILL_FLOATING.

## Session 2026-08-15 — Gantt/canvas desync + Gantt self-heal SHIPPED; Hospital lighting still floats, unexplained
Chased "Gantt Chart not followed" (user's own smoking-gun read of a live mp4) to two real, separate
bugs, both fixed+merged: **#1355 §GANTT_SHIFT_HOURS_DESYNC** (Gantt bars authored at 8h/day while
canvas plays 24h/day, measured 2.93x gap, matches the ratio exactly) + **#1359 §GANTT_SCHEDULE_STALE**
(the authored Gantt had no version-based self-heal at all, unlike kernel_ops — `schedules.gen_version`
now mirrors `_GANTT_CACHE_VERSION`, 6 safety cases verified incl. baselined/captured schedules never
touched). Also found+fixed the local `~/bim-ootb` checkout was 75 commits stale (sw.js v939 vs v1029)
— resynced. Full trail: `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` §GANTT_SHIFT_HOURS_DESYNC/§GANTT_SCHEDULE_
STALE/§HOSPITAL_LIGHTING_STILL_FLOATING.
- **⛔ OPEN, real bake evidence, all obvious causes ruled out with hard numbers:** post-fix, a live
  MaxQ bake on Hospital still shows ~100+ lighting/electrical fixtures floating. Measured directly:
  schedule math is provably correct for this whole class (1522/1523 zero violations), render path
  is a clean pass-through (no separate bug), pace/staleness/topout all fixed. Next session: check
  whether the LIVE session's own `kernel_ops` is stale (`§KERNEL_OPS_SCHED_VERSION stale` in console)
  before chasing anything new — if fresh, pull the exact floating GUID and diff element-by-element.

## Session 2026-08-14 — HHS stair root-caused + fixed, closing perf/dead-code pass, both SHIPPED+MERGED
Continuation of 2026-08-13's handed-off "3rd level hanging doors" item — chased the stairs half of it
(doors half still open, see below). Two bim-ootb PRs merged, `witness_midair_zero.js` 38/0 and
`witness_tier_serial_display.js` 57/0 clean throughout, full trail in `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md`
SESSION 6-7.
- **#1345 §STAIR_FLIGHT_GRID_VISIBILITY**: root cause one level deeper than 2026-08-13 had it —
  `IfcStairFlight` was never inserted into `schedule_gate.js`'s own support-visibility index
  (`structIdxGrid`/`grid`), so anything resting on a stair flight (a landing, e.g. HHS's Day-50
  report) found zero real support and scheduled unconstrained. Fixed with one narrow predicate
  mirroring the already-shipped `isPromotedSlab` pattern. HHS landing FINAL display gap: -40.85d →
  -0.11d. Two regressions caught and fixed BEFORE shipping (a DAG-cycle explosion from a pool-status
  omission, and a false witness regression from over-widening `auditFloating`) — see the PR/prompts
  file for the full self-correction trail.
- **#1347 chore**: removed a 95-line dead duplicate `_midairRepair` (JS hoisting silently shadowed
  it since 2026-08-12, already named as a known defect, never cleaned up) + de-duplicated a redundant
  `geoGate`/`wallGate` double-scan in `placeNonst`. Both verified byte-identical (witness pass/fail
  counts unchanged).
- **⛔ Named, MEASURED, not fixed — real find, next session's target**: `_tierAuditRegate`'s
  full-array-rescan fixpoint is the dominant cost of the WHOLE 4D generation pipeline on large
  buildings — ~78-90% of Terminal's 19.8s total gen time (9 sweeps × full O(n) rescan each, 85% of
  elements pushed), not element-count-driven (Hospital, more elements, remaps 7x faster). Needs a
  worklist/dirty-queue rewrite + its own equivalence witness — too large for a closing pass. Full
  numbers and concrete next steps in `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` SESSION 7.
- **⛔ STILL OPEN, not touched this session**: the "hanging doors" half of 2026-08-13's original
  report (only stairs were chased). Also: `_twoTierRemap` isn't support-DAG-aware for stair flights
  (can display flight 2 before flight 1) — papered over by `_midairRepair` for the shipped movie, the
  intermediate stage is still wrong. Both named, not folded into either PR above.

## Session 2026-08-13 — 4D "hanging in mid air": 3 real fixes shipped, 1 elusive item handed off
User: "solve this... you are the expert" → "chase till zero" → "THINGS STILL HANGING IN MID AIR" →
"the 3rd level again.. with the hanging doors." Three bim-ootb PRs merged, all gate_4d.sh clean:
- **#1333 §TIER2_PER_ELEMENT_CLAMP + §SHIFT_HOURS**: killed MEP dead-air (Hospital MEP Final
  occupancy 22%→105.4%) and reverted M1's 8h/day default back to 24h per user ruling — Hospital
  2020d live→369.2d, all 7 buildings shrank 1.7x–5.5x.
- **#1338 §GROUNDED_OVERRIDE_FIX**: found and fixed a pre-existing (not caused by #1333) audit bug —
  `_midairRepair`/`_midairAudit` let "grounded" (nothing below in an element's own tight footprint)
  silently override 1,105 real floating violations across 7 buildings (worst gaps 878.8d LTU_AHouse,
  172.3d Hospital) that `witness_midair_zero`'s "0 floating" had never actually checked.
- Architecture/Superstructure's own low occupancy: crew-scaling tested, ruled out (only ~7% crew
  utilization — not a capacity problem), points at a genuine critical-path effect, not yet traced.
- **⛔ OPEN, handed to next session**: "3rd level hanging doors" (likely HHS) — the shipped door/
  host-wall mechanism checks clean at both 8h and 24h shift, node-side. Full handoff with the exact
  next steps (live bake + render-sync check, not more node-side probing) at the top of
  `prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md`. New reusable probe: `scripts/probe_midair_grounded_and_doors.js`.

## Session 2026-08-12 — §MAIN_BUILDING_SHADOW SOLVED after 5 sessions stuck (bim-ootb PR #1302, MERGED)
Main building + rooftop fixtures cast no shadow in a MaxQ bake while skyline props and Time Machine's
Shadow mode both did. Root cause: `shadow.bias` is NORMALISED depth (`shadowCoord.z += shadowBias`
over [0,1] across near..far), so its world-space size is `bias x (far-near)`. `_enablePhotoShadows`
copied `toggleShadow`'s `-0.0005`, but toggleShadow moves the sun to ~150 m (range 609 m = 0.305 m)
while the photo path cannot move it (updateSky/Sky/lensflare read `A.sun.position`, sunDist=5000,
range 19,748 m = 9.874 m). 32.4x. Erases any caster under `casterHeight/sin(elevation)` ~ 8.1 m tall
at the 55 deg film opening — every rooftop fixture and a short building's ground shadow — while the
tall skyline props cleared it. Prior PRs #1293/#1295/#1298/#1299/#1300 all fixed real but different
bugs; none touched the depth comparison. Fix holds the WORLD-space bias (floor 0.305 m, raised to
`texel/tan(lowest arc elevation)` against grazing-sun acne). Paired A/B, only bias changed: 1,665 px
darkened at 55 deg, 12,095 at dusk, 0 brightened either. User confirmed shadows now seen. Also fixed
a stale-`matrixWorld` read that made `§PHOTO_SHADOW_FRUSTUM_COVERAGE` untrustworthy as evidence.
Full record: `prompts/PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md` §MAIN_BUILDING_SHADOW. Witnesses:
`scripts/witness_shadow_bias_{ab,postfix}.js`. sw.js v991->v992.
Also this session: user manual updated + published (BIMUserGuide "Sun, sky and shadow while the film
records" + Alt+S/Alt+J in the cheat-sheet + What's New entry) via `safe_gh_deploy.sh`, guard PASS
283->283 files, canaries 200, content verified live. And `prompts/PHOTOREAL_STILL_RENDER.md`
§SUN_START_TIME written SPEC-ONLY (fixed 6h film + one start-time setting, default 12:00, range
06:00-12:00 since 6h from any later start ends below the horizon; PHOTO_SUN_ELEVATION_START/_END
become elevationForHour() using TM's existing sine) and §WEATHER_ADVANCED_MODE written SPEC-ONLY (Twinmotion/Lumion parity ask): most machinery already
shipped (fog save/restore, §PHOTO_PUDDLE wet ground, §LAYER2_HDRI swap, §SUN_ARC, staffage) — the gap
is only clouds/precipitation/snow-accumulation/overcast; start at a Phase 1 overcast preset. Includes
the corrected finding that the MaxQ IndexedDB frame store is SCRATCH (deleted at both ends of every
bake) so there is no second-bake speedup today, and the dusk-shadow cosine-law answer (shadows ARE
cast on the roof, drowned by unshadowed fill the staging itself boosts; dusk drama and shadow contrast
are the same dial). NOT STARTED — user closed the session judging current realism good enough.

## Session 2026-08-11 — CPE POV walk "toppled/upside-down" camera FIXED+SHIPPED (bim-ootb PR #1292, MERGED)
User report: walk-mode camera rolls/flips easily, should behave like canvas mouse/finger nav. Root
cause: `cpe_walk.js` used THREE's default Euler `'XYZ'` order — pitch composes around WORLD X after
yaw, so any diagonal mouse move bakes real roll into the camera (OrbitControls never has this; it
uses clamped spherical coords). Fix: `'YXZ'` order (three.js's own PointerLockControls convention,
mathematically roll-free for any yaw/pitch) + fresh-spawn branch now re-levels immediately instead of
only on resume. Built in `/tmp/wt-cpe-walk-rollsnap` (worktree, pruned post-merge), not the shared
dirty checkout. Witness: new `witness_cpe_walk_roll_snap.js` 3/3 PASS, confirmed FAILS 2/3 on pre-fix
code (right.y up to 0.66 — a real regression catch, not a tautology); full regression unaffected
(`witness_cpe_walk_edit.js` 24/24, `witness_cpe_walk_ctrldrag_fix.js` 4/4). sw.js v983→v984. Full
diagnosis + fix record: `prompts/CPE_POV_WALK_PATHING.md` §CPE_WALK_ROLL_SNAP.

## Session 2026-08-11 — Modeller-vs-Revit competitive positioning: clipboard spec written, no code touched
Chat-only strategic session (bim-compiler root; target code is bim-ootb `modeller/` — nothing there edited,
read-only Explore verification only). Chain: why Revit/ArchiCAD don't bind IFC at placement time
(strategic — IFC is a competitor-neutral schema, not their moat) → what a Revit modeller's daily-routine
presets (office template, type catalogs, groups/copy-paste) already solve vs. the grunt work that survives
(project-specific Pset/classification filling, precedent-matched type selection) → recorded as
`prompts/PREFAB_LASSO_MACRO_LIBRARY_DIALOGUE.md` §6 (2026-08-11), extending its existing Revit-positioning
thread rather than forking a new doc. Picked the §4a static clipboard as the one safe-to-build item (pure
addition, no existing code touched) and split it into a real, grounded build spec:
`prompts/MODELLER_CLIPBOARD_COPY_PASTE.md`. An Explore pass against `bim-ootb origin/main` (`9197a09`)
corrected the original design's assumptions: `expandAssembly` doesn't fit a live-selection copy;
`foldInsert` + `arc_editable.js buildSeedOps()`'s non-catalog path does; signed-op-group commit is
`commitGesture` (grid-stretch's own pattern, undo/redo for free), not `commitSeedGroup`; DAG-guided
severance-aware pick needs new code, deferred out of scope. **⛔ BLOCKED: dispatch needs a user go + a check
that no other concurrent session already owns Modeller work** (cross-repo dispatch rule, see
`feedback_diagnose_in_session_fix_in_other_session` memory) — do not dispatch cold, ask first. Pset/
classification-mining track separately flagged, not started: check `DAGCompiler`/`internal/UNMERGED` source
IFCs directly for Pset presence before assuming a new mining pass is needed (user steer, 2026-08-11).

## Session 2026-08-10 — §NOGEO_COMPOSE push-to-zero items 1-3 ✅ SHIPPED+LIVE (bim-ootb #1266/#1267/#1268)
HHS_Office_Federated 41 ghosts→0 and Clinic 43→0 (a 4th affected building the checklist never listed —
found by sweeping the ghost query over EVERY shipped DB, not just JKR; JKR itself is 0). Real
`IfcRelAggregates` pairs only, no computed values; OCI uploads all `§GATE_VERDICT UPLOAD_VERIFIED`;
production `§LIVE_WITNESS PASS composed=41` / `composed=43` on the real GH-Pages viewer + live OCI bytes.
W-NOGEO-COMPOSE is now a committed re-runnable witness (`tests/witness_nogeo_compose.js`, 9/9 PASS
against the project's OWN bundled `sql-wasm.wasm`). Landmine caught pre-upload: `buildings/patches/` and
`viewer/buildings/patches/` are NOT the same file for HHS — uploading the root copy would have deleted
the live `spatial_structure` fix; uploaded the superset. Items 4-5 (extractor root-fix) still OPEN, now
with the storey-aggregate precondition measured safe. Full record + 2 new ⛔ (LTU_AHouse_meta 337 ghosts
= different class, needs a user decision; Modeller has NO compose port, 7 DBs) —
`prompts/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION.md` §NOGEO_COMPOSE (2026-08-10 second-session section).

## Session 2026-08-10 — CPE walk ctrl-drag exit SHIPPED; Viewer prompts audit + 4D consolidation plan (SHIPPED — see 2026-08-15 correction below)
§CPE_WALK_CTRL_DRAG_EXIT (bim-ootb PR #1261, MERGED+LIVE): Ctrl-held-drag during POV walk mode was
exiting walk unexpectedly — OrbitControls stayed live on the same canvas and threw `setPointerCapture`
InvalidStateError under pointer lock; Ctrl+drag's context-menu path forced an unplanned Pointer-Lock
release. Fixed by disabling `A.controls` + suppressing `contextmenu` for the walk-mode duration
(mirrors the existing TM-lock pause/restore pattern). Witnessed 24/24 regression + 4/4 new gates.
Separately: wrote `prompts/VIEWER_PROMPTS_LANE_OVERLAP_AUDIT.md` (survey of all Viewer-space prompt
files for cross-lane file collisions — notes only, no fixes; headline finding was that the survey's
own OPEN/CLOSED status labels were unreliable, 2 of 3 spot-checked were already stale). Then planned
a `time_machine.js` promotion-classifier consolidation + Modeller ghost-compose port (full plan
archived in `prompts/archive/4D_SCHEDULE_PERFECTION_full_history_2026-08-03_to_2026-08-12.md`).
**[CORRECTED 2026-08-15 — this line was stale]: the promotion-classifier dedup shipped**, PR #1272
(2026-08-10) + PR #1347 (`_midairRepair` dead-dup removal), both MERGED. It only ever closed a
duplication/DRY item, never `§TM_GEO_ORDER_CYCLES`. The separate, much bigger 2026-08-15
"consolidate/split 5000+ lines" ask is a different scope and is still open — see that session's line
above (§TIME_MACHINE_CONSOLIDATION_SPEC).

## Session 2026-08-08 — §27 (Viewer perf/crash) chased to ZERO, 2 PRs SHIPPED+MERGED+LIVE
User-priority WORK-TO-ZERO item from `FLY_TOUR_DLOD_SCALE.md` §27 (overrode Watchdog's "stop here").
§26 `_boxIndex` null-deref crash on rapid DLOD-nav `o`/`o` toggle: idempotency-guard fix in

pre-fix, zero crashes post-fix) — bim-ootb PR #1259 MERGED. §BVH_DEFERRED 41-54s stall: user
correctly suspected the just-concluded night-lighting session's own un-merged fix
(`§NIGHT_STILL_BOOST_GATE_FIX`, nav mode silently running ~200 lights instead of 30) — controlled
real-GPU A/B isolated it exactly (buggy+busy interaction never finished within 90s; fixed+busy
finished in 9.8s; light count alone, idle, was cheap either way) — bim-ootb PR #1255 MERGED, no new

## Session 2026-08-06 — Room-pathing: §SPINE-BRIDGE-CLUSTER + §REVISIT_FORCED, both SHIPPED+MERGED
Continued from `prompts/Viewer/FindRooms/RESUME_ROOMPATH_DETOUR_BACKTRACK.md` (now fully CLOSED,
all 4 items resolved). Root-caused LTU_AHouse's `V1R1→V4R1` NO_PATH: `§ROOM-SPINE-BRIDGE` only
bridged zero-degree rooms, so a 2-room door-pair island (degree 1, no route to the corridor) was
never even attempted. Fixed by bridging per connected-component instead of per-node degree — bim-ootb
PR #1200, `origin/main` @ `5a68932`. Fleet POC gate: 6 such components/12 rooms, all on LTU_AHouse,
zero elsewhere (Hospital/Clinic/Terminal/JKR/HHS/TermRooms). Regression: 89,627 existing room pairs
0 lost/0 changed, 3,500 newly connected (LTU only).

Second, unrelated finding while closing the length-guard UX question (`§NOREVISIT-LENGTH-GUARD`,
kept as-is by user decision): the revisit-guard's "no alternative exists at all" outcome logged
nothing, indistinguishable from a clean detour. One-line log-only fix (`§PATH_LEGAL_DETOUR_REVISIT_
FORCED`), behavior-unchanged by construction, spot-verified byte-identical route — bim-ootb PR
#1210, `origin/main` @ `8574e51`. Real occurrence: 437 fleet-wide (318 LTU, 119 Clinic).

## Session 2026-08-05 — §CLASS_UNMATCHED_INHERITED (schema-exhaustive tier-2 fallback) SHIPPED
Watchdog/reviewer session, continued from `RESUME_SESSION_2026-08-05_WATCHDOG.md`. Verified+landed the
dev session's §CLASS_UNMATCHED_FALLBACK fix (bim-ootb PR #1186, #1187 — real IFC4 hierarchy, not
guessed; witness confirmed 3→0 then 5→0 unmatched classes across 7 buildings). Then spec'd+built the
schema-exhaustive follow-on: `prompts/BUILDINGSMART_IFC_SCHEMA_CLASSIFICATION.md`, PR bim-ootb#1191
(auto-merge armed, pending CI at session close) — `tools/dump_ifc_schema_hierarchy.py` walks
`ifcopenshell`'s real IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3 schema (1006 classes) into `viewer/rates/
ifc_schema_hierarchy.json`; `matchRule()` (all 3 copies) gets a tier-2 ancestor-walk fallback below
the existing explicit `SEQUENCE_RULES` tier. Ground truth verified against buildingSMART's own raw
`.exp` file, not an AI summary of it (caught+documented a real WebFetch hallucination in the process —
see the spec's §THE WEBFETCH LESSON). Witnessed: `witness_schema_exhaustive_fallback.js` (NEW, P3)
tier1=132/tier2=53/tier3=821, pass=6/fail=0; full named regression 205/205; re-verified after a real
`sw.js` merge conflict against a concurrently-landed PR #1190.

**Follow-on spec'd, not built:** `prompts/CLASSIFICATION_EXACT_LOOKUP_BLINDSPOT.md` — 6 consumers
(`boq_charts.html`'s crew chart, `proj_fold.js`'s ERP push, `variation_order.js`, `export_5d.js`'s
`WORK_PACKAGES`, `schedule_read_4d.js` fallback) do exact `SEQUENCE_RULES[cls]` lookup, never call
`matchRule()`, so they get NEITHER tier 1 substring matching NOR tier 2 — silently miss any
`...Type`-suffixed class or the 58 real occurrence classes still unclassified (named in the parent
spec). Not a regression from today's work — pre-existing, just newly surfaced by the blast-radius check.

**Dev session picked up the follow-on live during this session's closeout**, working directly in
`/tmp/wt-ifc-schema-classification` (same branch as open PR #1191) — left untouched throughout
(watchdog-role, no git ops on another session's in-progress worktree). Per their own P1 update to
`CLASSIFICATION_EXACT_LOOKUP_BLINDSPOT.md`: `classify()` exported from `schedule_author.js`
(pass-through wrapper around `matchRule`'s real tier 1→2→3), new `witness_schema_exhaustive_classify.js`
5/5 pass (byte-identical to `matchRule` across all 1006 classes, tier split pinned 132/53/821), existing
`witness_schema_exhaustive_fallback.js` still 6/6 unchanged. Not yet committed/pushed as of this
session's close. Next session: check PR #1191 merged, then check P1's commit status before starting P2
(wire `boq_charts.html`'s crew chart + `proj_fold.js`'s ERP push through `classify()`).

## Session 2026-08-03 — Offline install doc shipped, docs-publish blocked
`docs/OFFLINE_INSTALL_GUIDE.md` added (Viewer + iDempiere/ERP only, Modeller deliberately excluded —
its mesh.db LFS bug is unrelated), linked from `USER_GUIDE.md`, committed+pushed to
`fable/meshdb-livewire` (`3b0afe3d2`). ⛔ **Live docs-site publish still BLOCKED**: `scripts/safe_gh_deploy.sh`
aborted on a 13-file merge conflict vs `origin/master` (`PROGRESS.md`, `extractIFCtoDB.py`,
several `prompts/*.md`, a witness file) — unrelated to this doc, guard correctly refused to auto-pick a
side. Needs a human merge call before the new page (or any docs change) goes live.

## Current State
**Gate:** `./scripts/run_RosettaStones.sh` — S190 fleet: 116/157 PASS, 4 ALL GREEN (BR,MO,RL,WI). 21 buildings. 9-gate system.
| PFX | EL | GATES | Notes |
|-----|----|-------|-------|
| BR·MO·RL·WI | 33·2791·1·1 | 9/9 | ALL GREEN |
| DX | 1169 | 8/9 | MetadataMissing (IfcOpeningElement) |
| SH | 65 | 8/9 | MetadataMissing (generative MEP) |
| TE | 48428 | 8/10 | C8 mesh diversity, GEO no pairs (federated) |

**Pipeline:** 11 stages. 77 verbs. 7403 products (ERP.db). 4-DB architecture.
▶ **PUSH PAUSE LIFTED (2026-07-17)** — push freely; `CLAUDE.md` §⏸ PUSH PAUSE.

⚠ `~/bim-ootb` main checkout is stale + conflicts on `merge origin/main` (tried+aborted 07-26); its local
commits are NOT unique so nothing is at risk — **never measure from it**, use a fresh `origin/main` worktree.

▶ **Roompath openings-backfill lane CLOSED 2026-08-03** — `prompts/Viewer/FindRooms/
RESUME_FLEET_OPENINGS_BACKFILL.md` §LANE STATE: extractor openings fix permanent, 9/9 DBs
ghost-shaped, §HM v3 two-layer metric is the headline (fleet draw backlog 157 links; buildings
healthy in record). Next session resumes at its NEXT SESSION block. Hospital_3 DB rm'd (user;
backup /tmp/db_bak_2026-08-02/). **Separate detour-backtrack lane also CLOSED 2026-08-06** —
`RESUME_ROOMPATH_DETOUR_BACKTRACK.md`, see session entry above (PR #1178, #1200, #1210 merged).
The BIG room-pathing effort (Clinic 49.3%, axis resweep) below is still open, unaffected by either.

▶ **In-flight work is NOT listed here — read it from git; every hand-written copy has been wrong.**
`gh pr list --state open` · unmerged-no-PR: `for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)'
refs/heads/); do n=$(git rev-list --count origin/main..$b); [ "$n" -gt 0 ] && echo "$n $b"; done | sort -rn`.
0 commits only-on-this-disk (both repos, re-verified 07-30). Undelivered: `lane/hr-overlay`, `lane/teams-overlay`.

## OPEN — to be assigned to sessions (user dispatches from this list, check before starting cold)
- ▶▶ **4D SUPPORT INVARIANT** — `prompts/GANTT_ACCURACY.md` §ELEMENT_CPM. Ruling 2026-08-02: support
  wins but NOT merged (support 6,778→0, floating 0, but band regresses 29,824→34,595 — band is
  user-confirmed live). Root cause: storey-LABEL ladder wrong in 1,735/81,722 support edges (2.1%), by
  elevation **zero**. 4 engine shapes already measured and rejected — don't retry. NEXT: move BOTH the
  trade gate and the band gate onto the elevation key (band alone isn't enough — trade still keys on
  label, 23,121 elements sit in two groupings, barrier deadlocks). Engine/support-extraction/crew-pool
  built and reusable.
- ▶ **ROOM PATHING** — `prompts/Viewer/FindRooms/VIEWER_FIND_PANEL_ROOM_ACCURACY.md`, read `ROOM_PATHING_SUBSTRATE.md` FIRST (new: concept,
  invariants, every failed trial, prior art, §0 index of all 30 lane docs), then resume at §21.44. ⚠ Everything before §21.33 is SUPERSEDED/disproven — don't
  re-derive. Three defects found and fixed 2026-08-02: §PRECARVE (retention 84%/43%→100%/100%), the
  unhosted-void admission (default `W:3.0`), and the door pierce (6*RES→10*RES). **LTU stranded
  107→18/277, unroutable 87.7%→18.4% — beats the room-graph baseline 32.4% AND survives the
  phantom-adjacency cap test (share 104%→20%).** Standing 4-witness gate all green: §T1–T5 (retention
  100%/100%), §O3, §SC3 breaks 11/34→9/14, §CB5 sealed suites 9/23→7/8.
  ⛔ **Clinic still short: 50/186 @ 49.3%.** §21.43/§21.44 (2026-08-02) — resume at **§21.44**, three
  things now SETTLED, do not re-derive: (a) §21.41's doorway-merge **falsified before coding** (it
  separates — 0.0% of >10 m² pockets misclassify — but reaches 1 of 8 far-end groups; §C40c's "41 far
  ends" were 41 records over 8 groups); (b) §21.41's root cause **retracted** — doorway pockets carry
  2–5 door-matched openings each, the graph does not die in them; (c) the `rel_contained_in_space`
  "free win" **retracted, it is circular** — written by our own `compile_rooms.py:1295`, 100% `RM_*`/`≈`
  rows, 1 space per door. This lane still has NO independent oracle. **NEW ROOT CAUSE (§21.43): the
  void carve is TRANSPOSED** — `_rasterizeSpine` max/min-normalises every void long-along-world-x, so
  46% of Clinic's doors and 57% of LTU's are carved 90° wrong (rotation can't correct it: the
  `COALESCE(t.rotation_z,0)` column is selected with no alias, so 0 of 3,167 voids and 0 of 4,979 walls
  ever carry it — harmless only because the fixtures store world AABBs). **The correct fix makes every
  metric worse** (§O3 phantom 20% PASS→94% FAIL, LTU 18.4%→23.0%, Clinic 49.3%→50.4%): the wrong carve
  over-removes wall and that is what was merging pockets, so `W:3.0` and `pierce=10*RES` were both
  swept against a geometric error and 18.4% is not a clean win. NEXT: joint (W, pierce) re-sweep on
  corrected axes — patch kept unapplied at `roompath_diagnostics/patch_21_43_transpose.diff`;
  worker prompt ready at `prompts/Viewer/FindRooms/RESUME_ROOMPATH_AXIS_RESWEEP.md` (Fable-class).
  19 witnesses on bim-ootb `review/roompath-redundancy`, worktree `/tmp/wt-roompath` live/clean/pushed
  — REUSE it. Nothing deployed; engine byte-unchanged. Blocks `datacentre_cabling.md` cable-pathing.
- ▶ **MODELLER** — dispatch from `prompts/MODELLER_MASTER.md` (⚠ landmine found compacting this file
  2026-08-02: that file is NOT on this branch, only on unmerged `fix/lod400-envelope-hardfail` — merge or
  recreate it before dispatching from it). ✅ LIVE-DEFECT CLOSED: Modeller drew bounding-box fallbacks on
  the live site for months (Git-LFS `mesh.db` unresolved on GH Pages, failure hidden behind
  DevTools-filtered `console.warn`) — fixed via per-resident geo files + `_assertRealGeoDb()` guard + sw
  v37→v38, bim-ootb #1090/#1091 merged. Curl-the-served-bytes lesson now standing in `feedback_terse`.
- `RESUME_MODELLER_LOD400_REAL_GEOMETRY.md §LOD400-ENVELOPE` (PR #56) — done: `rel_material_layer_set`
  edge + P10 gate, witness 8/8. OPEN: §LOD400-LAYERS-REAL (slice the envelope at authored thickness) —
  needs the one-mesh-per-element vs N-sub-instances call first. Old §LODHELL FINDING 1 verdict is
  SUPERSEDED, don't re-cite. ⚠ 2026-08-03 merge with `origin/master` brought in a large parallel batch
  of already-shipped LOD400-layers work (rows 3/4/16-34, PRs #56-#65, `MODELLER_MASTER.md` restored) —
  this bullet is stale against it, needs a re-read+rewrite next session. One gap found merging (anchor
  `elements_meta` rows wrote `building=NULL`) — ✅ FIXED same session, witness 7/7, see WATCHDOG
  CORRECTIONS item 3 in that file.

- ▶ **KUL070 datacentre** — `prompts/datacentre_cabling.md` (cabling) / `prompts/IFC_LARGE_PRIVATE_STRESS_TEST.md`
  (ingestion, §KUL009-13). Ingestion CLOSED: the 62,500 "missing" elements were the wasm32 4GB ceiling
  (not the call stack) — 8-way split → 87,333-element DB, 0 orphans. ⚠ §KUL013: `center_*` is the
  placement ORIGIN not the AABB centre (median 11.31 m off) — `disc_walker.routeChains` misuses it, 0.00%
  vs 90.07% precision, needs its own session. Cabling: engineer confirmed all 3 pain points, wants
  auto-routing first. **⛔ NEXT SESSION PRECONDITION: review ROOMS pathing first** — cable pathing
  inherits the same A*/polyline/highlight engine and its unmeasured redundant-path defects (today 8/119
  runs traversable = 6.7%, not the 41% name-resolution figure). Ship F1/F2/F6 first — none need a
  pathing engine.

- ▶ **Parked lane carried over from the master branch (2026-07-29 list):** `prompts/CINEMA_FIND_TO_FILM.md`
  — specced, not started, no code owed. (The other three of that list — §HOVER_NAME, §CPE_ROOM_TITLE,
