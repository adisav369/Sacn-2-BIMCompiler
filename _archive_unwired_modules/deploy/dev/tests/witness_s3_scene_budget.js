/**
 * # ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE — W-S3-SCENE-BUDGET scope (READ THE LOG after every run)
 * SCOPE: prompts/Viewer/FLY_TOUR_CORRIDOR_GRAPH.md §STAKEHOLDER_STROLL S3 — replace the per-storey
 * room budget (`K = storeys>=4 ? 2 : storeys===3 ? 3 : 4`, plus up to 3 corridors, PER STOREY) with
 * a WHOLE-BUILDING scene checklist capped at SCENE_BUDGET. "The tour is a stroll, not a survey":
 * a 7-storey Hospital sweeping every floor into 22 stops is a survey. Storeys stop being the
 * iteration unit; scenes are.
 *
 * ISSUE IT PROVES/DISPROVES — the spec's own gate, plus the baseline it rests on:
 *   (G0) THE BASELINE IS MEASURED HERE, NOT QUOTED. The spec says "Hospital 22 stops → ≤10". A
 *        witness that only checks the ≤10 half proves nothing about the change — it would pass on a
 *        building that was already at 7. So this witness runs the SAME building twice in one go:
 *        once against the PRE-S3 tour.js (`git show HEAD~:…/tour.js`, served from a symlink farm so
 *        the repo tree is never mutated) and once against the working tree. Both numbers land in
 *        the log, from the same fixture, same run.
 *        ⚠ This gate exists because of a watchdog catch on S1: figures cited from terminal output
 *        with no §-line behind them are not evidence under this project's Log Mandate.
 *   (G1) Hospital: stop count DROPS and lands ≤10.
 *   (G2) The main hall is still FIRST — §FLY_HL_FIRST is re-asserted and its elected hall is the
 *        same measured area champion, and §HL-ORIGIN still starts the walk low. S3 was supposed to
 *        change SELECTION only, never ORDER; this is what would catch it changing order by accident.
 *   (G3) Clinic stays a coherent stroll (it was already inside budget — it must not be trimmed or
 *        inflated by the rewrite), and NO building's stop list becomes empty.
 *   (G5) THE BUDGET IS A CEILING, NOT A TARGET: post-S3 stops ≤ pre-S3 stops, on EVERY building.
 *        Added after the first run: the first cut filled every building to exactly 10, taking
 *        Clinic 7 → 10. It passed a "≤10 and non-empty" check while doing the opposite of what S3
 *        is for — trimming a survey, not padding a stroll. A one-sided cap check cannot see that.
 *   (G4) The election is auditable from the log, not asserted: §FLY_SCENE_BUDGET reports the
 *        budget, the pool size, the elected roles and how many storeys the stops actually span —
 *        so "it still climbs" is readable rather than assumed.
 *
 * ⚠ FIXTURE RULE (unchanged, measured 2026-07-26): room-bearing DBs are LOCAL, `~/bim-ootb/buildings/`
 * — never fetched from OCI. Symlinked in per run, removed after.
 *
 * RUN: node deploy/dev/tests/witness_s3_scene_budget.js   (serves deploy/dev itself on PORT)
