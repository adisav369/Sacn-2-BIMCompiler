# DESIGN DIALOGUE (reference only, NOT a build spec) — Graph-aware prefab picking, escalating lasso, mineable macro library

```
# ⚠ DO NOT REMOVE
STATUS: pure design-dialogue record, 2026-07-05. NOTHING in this doc is built, and unlike
prompts/GRID_PREDRAG_PREVIEW_SAVE_COMPLETEIT.md this one is deliberately NOT yet split into session-assignable
specs — the ideas need more settling first (user's own call: prove the smallest piece — twig-based macro
capture — useful to one user before deciding anything bigger). This doc SUPERSEDES the original scoping note
for `prompts/UBBL_RULES_RECON.md`'s sibling ("parametric depth recon") — that recon's original framing ("what's
missing for parametric authoring") is now too narrow; see §RESCOPE at the end.
```

## ORIGIN — why "parametric, more differently"
Triggered by a question: given this project's core bet (compile/extract real measured data, never invent —
PRIME RULE), what would a genuinely different, non-Revit-shaped answer to "parametric authoring" look like,
rather than building a smaller version of a family editor? Two seed ideas, both elaborated below:
1. LOD meshes don't need drawing — an editor that touches up REAL measured geometry along axes the corpus
   proves are real variables, not axes a CAD kernel merely permits.
2. Raw authoring can instead be picking real ARC shells out of already-extracted real buildings and continuing
   them 3DGrid-wise — prefab, not freehand drawing.

## §1 — LOD touch-up editor: parametric axes = mined variance, not CAD constraints
Don't expose an editable dimension unless the real corpus shows actual measured variance on it (e.g. if the
mined door-class corpus varies 700–1000mm in width but has constant panel depth across every real instance,
width is a legitimate touch-up axis, depth isn't — that's a measured fact, not a modeling choice). Mechanically
this isn't a new engine: it reuses the SAME stretch machinery already built for grid-drag (`EDGE_STRETCH`,
attach-map classification — see `GRID_PREDRAG_GREENORANGE_PREVIEW.md`), scoped to one component's local frame
instead of the building grid. It also plugs into the calibrated-confidence machinery already shipped for the
walker (`WC_CALIBRATION`, isotonic/PAV, see `project_walker_guards_rosettastone` memory): a touch-up edit that
falls outside the corpus's real measured range isn't blocked, it's flagged low-confidence — same epistemic
honesty already applied to disc-borrowing, now applied to hand-edits.
**Open, unanswered:** does the library mining already capture per-class variance ranges today, or does that
need a new mining pass before any touch-up axis can be trusted as real rather than assumed? Not checked in this
dialogue — first thing a follow-on recon must answer.

## §2 — ARC-shell prefab: generalize BOM recursion + `expandAssembly`, don't build a new insert path
A room/wing/floor-plate from an already-extracted real building is already a BOM sub-tree (BOM PRINCIPLE:
recursive, one parent, N children, each level atomic). `bonsai_library.js`'s `expandAssembly`/`foldInsert`
already places a BOM assembly into a scene with correct placement math, today at furniture/fixture grain.
Treating a whole ARC shell as one pickable, insertable BOM node is the same mechanism at a bigger grain, not a
new one.

### §2a — Pick granularity: DAG-guided lasso, not a fixed BOM-boundary-only pick
Resolved in dialogue: don't force the pick to only ever be a pre-existing BOM node (too rigid) or a fully free
lasso (risks severing a real relationship mid-cut). Instead: a free lasso **guided by the already-live typed
edge graph**. **Verified 2026-07-05 (`modeller/cross_edges.js` header):** the graph (`abuts`/`fills`/etc.) is
explicitly **RUNTIME-derived**, computed once per Open (`window.swXEdges = CrossEdges.deriveAll(db)` in
`str_walker_outliner.js:148`), near-linear (sweep-and-prune, proven at 48k-element Terminal scale), cached in
a browser global for the rest of the session, cleared on Clear — NOT baked into the DB (the file's own comment:
"the modeller's residents stay pristine"). This is a **deliberate divergence from the old Java DAGCompiler
pipeline**, which DID persist a compile-time `system_edges` table (`DAGCompiler/python/output_schema.sql:71`,
`CompilationPipeline.java:1225`) — that pipeline is separately flagged low-urgency/retired elsewhere in memory;
the live Modeller does not read from or extend it. Because the graph is already live in memory the instant a
building is open, a lasso can consult it live, mid-drag, for free — no new persistence or compute model needed:
if the boundary would cut between two elements joined by a real edge, either auto-extend the selection to
include the neighbour, or highlight the specific severed edge (reusing the generic `_emis` highlight already
built for the gate) so severing is a conscious choice, not an accident.

### §2b — Conform paths on drop/paste, three distinct axes
Resolved: offer BOTH default states (green/island = keeps native proportions, orange/conform = adapts to the
target), with the ORANGE side itself splitting into (at least) three sub-paths, each mapping to something real:
1. **Align/snap-to-grid** — most literal; the existing grid-snap mechanism, applied to the whole shell as one
   rigid unit before its internal elements get individually re-classified governed/interior.
2. **Frame likeness** — generalizes `grid_kinematics`' ATTACH/EDGE/SPAN classification to the shell's OWN
   internal structural elements, matched against the target's grid spacing.
3. **Material-wise** — **UNVERIFIED, flagged don't-assume:** BOM PRINCIPLE lists AttributeSets as one of the
   three concerns (WHAT/HOW/WHERE), but this dialogue did NOT confirm material/finish is a real, populated,
   per-element mined fact today vs. an unpopulated schema slot. Do not build this path before checking — if
   material isn't real data yet, "material-wise conform" would be a knob with nothing real behind it.

## §3 — Escalating lasso: room-scoped, data-driven ladder (not a fixed taxonomy)
Repeat-click on the same pick escalates: chair → all chairs (IN THE SAME ROOM — user-confirmed ceiling, never
building-wide by default) → dining set (ONLY if a real BOM-assembly-parent fact exists — i.e. the furniture was
originally placed as one `GEOM_INSERT` of an assembly, table+chairs together) → all furniture in room (the
already-real room-containment fact from the shipped bom-graph TREE, Building→Storey→Room→element, PR #539).
**The ladder must introspect what's actually real for that specific instance and skip any tier that isn't
backed by a fact** — a loose, individually-placed chair with no assembly sibling should skip straight from
"this chair" → "all chairs in room" → "room", never inventing a fake "dining set" tier. Offering a tier with no
real grouping behind it violates the same non-invent discipline that governs the rest of this project.

## §4 — Clipboard, macro capture, and "twig of another tone"
Two escalating capabilities discussed, worth keeping distinct:

### §4a — Static clipboard (smallest, most immediate)
A DAG-guided pick (§2a/§3) held in an in-session buffer (element IDs + the real BOM subtree), pasted with
conform-intent (§2b) re-resolved fresh at each target. This is the natural, well-specified shape for the
copy-paste primitive already flagged as a total gap in `GRID_PREDRAG_PREVIEW_SAVE_COMPLETEIT.md` §B's sibling
research (zero clipboard/copy/paste/duplicate hits anywhere in `modeller/`) — same missing feature, now much
better specified than "just add copy-paste."

### §4b — Macro capture on a lightweight personal "twig" (bigger, genuinely new)
**Checked and corrected in-dialogue:** the Teams overlay's "bundle" concept (`teams/overlay/share_bundle.js`)
is NOT this — it's a review/communication artifact (N post-it comments packaged into a shareable punch-list
with BCF-style deep-links), not a replayable sequence of geometry edits. A macro-recorder would be genuinely
new work. It IS architecturally well-motivated by something that already exists: a grid-stretch already commits
as ONE signed group of ops (not one op per element) — proven pattern for "group atomic ops into one signed
transaction." A macro-recorder generalizes this: start/stop recording a slice of ops as one named group, save
it, and — the part that makes it more than a static clipboard — **replay it with re-resolution, not blind
translation** (if a recorded step was "attach to nearest wall," replay re-runs that host-lookup fresh at the
new target, it doesn't copy the old wall's ID). **Open design question, per-op-type, not answered here:** which
op types replay relative (host lookup, grid-attach — re-resolve) vs. absolute (rare, probably none by default).

The "twig" should be a DIFFERENT branch concept from Teams' Distributed Design Branches (parallel team design
alternatives, gated by a real merge/review process) — a disposable, personal, lightweight fork whose only job is
isolating an edit sequence for capture, not collaborative design exploration. Same underlying signed-op
substrate, deliberately different purpose — keep them conceptually separate so "branch" doesn't grow two
incompatible meanings in the same codebase.

### §4c — The bigger vision: the op-log itself as a mineable corpus of edit behavior
User's framing: the whole signed-op timeline already has "memory of all sorts of edit combos over time" whether
anyone declares interest in them or not. Rather than macros being hand-authored (a human decides "this sequence
is worth saving"), a repeated edit-combo could be **noticed and promoted** — the same extract-don't-invent
discipline that built the component library and the residential clearance standards (`project_dx_mep_
residential_standard`), pointed at BEHAVIOR instead of geometry. A promotable pattern earns trust by real
recurrence across genuine editing sessions, the same way `WC_CALIBRATION` earns disc-borrowing confidence from
real recurrence rather than a single observation — not by a human hand-curating a template library.
**Deliberately NOT scoped further here** — genuinely bigger, harder question (per-user vs. cross-user pattern
sharing, promotion threshold, whether Teams' existing sync/ERP-bridge plumbing is the right transport if
patterns ever get shared across users) that the user explicitly deferred: prove §4b (single-user twig capture)
useful first, before deciding anything about promotion/sharing.

## §5 — RESCOPE NOTE for the parametric-depth recon
The original plan (see earlier session note, before this dialogue) was a single recon item ("what's missing for
parametric authoring"). This dialogue makes clear that's now several distinct, separately-answerable questions,
not one:
1. Does the library mining already capture per-class real-variance ranges (§1), or does new mining work come
   first?
2. What BOM-node granularities already exist as natural shell-pick units across the corpus (§2), and is a
   DAG-guided free lasso (§2a) actually needed, or do existing BOM boundaries already cover the common case?
3. Is material/finish a real, populated per-element fact anywhere in the corpus today (§2b-3), or unbuilt?
4. Does any real BOM-assembly-parent grouping fact exist for library-inserted furniture sets today (§3), to
   confirm the "dining set" escalation tier is ever real, not hypothetical?
Do not dispatch a single "parametric depth" recon session against the old framing — split per the above, or at
minimum brief whoever picks this up with these four sharper questions instead of the original generic one.

## Related design-dialogue context (same conversation, adjacent but not part of this doc's scope)
- Competitive positioning vs. Revit/ArchiCAD/Tekla/Bonsai — signed op-log ledger, REPORTS-ONLY gate/backprop,
  ERP-fused DocAction lifecycle (`MODELLER_SAVE_COMPLETEIT.md`), Compile-not-Model/walker doctrine, and
  browser-native IFC-first are the genuine differentiators; parametric authoring depth, structural analysis
  integration, and (until tested) multi-user collaboration are the honest gaps.
- Teams overlay (Distributed Design Branches) is SHIPPED (suite 18/18, OCI demo live per
  `project_teams_distributed_branches` memory) but NOT tested for a real dual-session live user path — flagged
  as the cheapest, highest-priority item to verify before treating multi-user as either a gap or a strength.
- Clash analysis vs. incumbents (Navisworks/Solibri/Revit interference check): geometric interference is
  commodity/already matched; real-time in-authoring auto-heal is arguably already ahead structurally; real
  engineering-analytical rule-library DEPTH (code-mandated soft-clashes, discipline-pair exclusions beyond
  `fillsPairs`) is the genuinely hard part — a multi-year data-sourcing marathon in the same class as the
  residential-clearance mining already shipped and the UBBL recon now underway, not an algorithmic problem.
