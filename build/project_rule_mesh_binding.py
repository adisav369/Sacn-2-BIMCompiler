project_rule_mesh_binding.py — mine each (disc, ifc_class)'s DOMINANT real geometry_hash
from a building's own extraction (element_instances guid→geometry_hash) into its class
rules DB as `rule_mesh_binding`.

WHY (§NOSPACES N3, RESUME_DISC_WALKER_ENVELOPE_BOUND.md item 2, 2026-07-10): the no-spaces
measured placement path must satisfy the LOD400 law (WalkerDoctrine §11 UNBREAKABLE) —
every generated fixture carries a REAL mesh reference or REFUSEs. The walker reads RULES
ONLY (anti-cheat: it never opens the building's MEP rows), so the binding must live in the
rules DB, mined here once from measured data — the same projection doctrine as
project_rule_space_schedule.py / project_rule_shim.py.

NON-INVENT: the hash is the statistical MODE of the class's real instances (most-frequent
real geometry_hash — a measured majority, never a synthesized or borrowed shape); n_of/n_total
records how dominant it is; src_guids samples the real elements it came from. A class absent
from the extraction gets NO row → the walker REFUSEs it honestly.

DISC MAPPING: (disc, ifc_class) pairs come from the rules DB's own rule_placement rows —
the classes the walker can generate — never from a hand list.

ALSO STAMPS `z_datum_offset` into rules_meta (§NOSPACES frame reconciliation, measured this
session): rule_placement's z-bands were baked in the 2026-06-28 extraction's building-datum
frame; the extraction has since been re-datumed to the site frame (+~14.59 m). The offset is
MEASURED per rule row as median(current site z of the row's own src_guids) − band midpoint,
then the median across rows is stamped (this run: 14.593, MAD 0.33 over 37 rows). The walker
adds it to every band it uses — no constant lives in code.

ALSO STAMPS `rule_frame_ref` (§TE-ARC-DATUM-FIX, RESUME_DISC_WALKER_ENVELOPE_BOUND.md, 2026-07-10):
per-class reference z-stats (n, mean center_z in the BAND frame) for every non-generatable class —
the walker measures the band→substrate z-offset at WALK time (median of per-class deltas vs the
walked db) so shipped substrates in a different frame (Terminal_ARC.db = raw-IFC building frame,
−14.66 m from the extraction's site frame) reconcile without baking any one target frame.
