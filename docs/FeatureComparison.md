# BIM OOTB — Technical Feature Paper

> **For the ERP side**, see the one-page evaluator companion — **[Migrate & Compare (ERP)](MigrateComparisonPaper.md)** — legacy ERP vs the WASM event-sourced browser.

## What It Is

BIM OOTB is a browser-based IFC viewer that runs entirely on the client. No server. No cloud subscription. No software to install. Open a URL, drop an IFC file, and view a full BIM model with construction scheduling, cost breakdown, and clash detection — all in a single browser tab.

The viewer handles buildings from 200 to 122,000+ elements with smooth orbit, pick, and section cut — and a **whole-city view that streams a 1,000,000+ element city** (52 buildings, 24 archetypes) in the same single browser tab. After first load, it works offline from local cache. The entire application is under 500KB of code.

## How It Works

### IFC In, Building Out

An IFC file is parsed once into a SQLite database. Geometry is content-hashed and deduplicated — identical columns, beams, or fittings share one mesh. The database is cached locally in the browser's IndexedDB. On return visits, the building loads from cache in under one second.

### Split-Database Streaming

For large buildings (15,000+ elements), the database is split into three files:

| File | Size (Terminal, 48K elements) | Loads in |
|------|------|----------|
| Positions (bbox centres) | 1.1 MB | <1 second |
| Metadata (properties, transforms) | 17 MB | 1-2 seconds |
| Geometry (mesh BLOBs) | 249 MB | Background stream |

The viewer shows the building outline instantly from positions, populates storey/discipline panels from metadata, and streams real geometry in the background sorted by camera distance — nearest elements appear first. You can orbit, pick, and filter while geometry is still loading.

### Rendering Pipeline

The viewer uses [Three.js r184](https://threejs.org/) (Apr 2025) with physically-based rendering (PBR). Upgraded from r160 across 24 releases — r184 brings better uniform uploads, tighter draw call batching, and a WebGPU-ready architecture with seamless WebGL fallback. See [Three.js release notes](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/releases) and [WebGPU migration guide](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation).

- **Geometry instancing**: Elements sharing the same shape are rendered as a single GPU draw call via `BatchedMesh`. A 122K-element building produces roughly 15,000 draw calls instead of 122,000.
- **IFC-faithful materials**: Colours are extracted from the IFC's own `IfcSurfaceStyle` definitions. Where the IFC author assigned no colour (common in Revit exports), a class-based palette provides physically plausible defaults — concrete is warm grey, steel is reflective, glass is smooth and blue-tinted.
- **Per-class PBR properties**: Roughness and metalness vary by IFC class. Structural steel (IfcBeam, IfcColumn) is smooth and reflective. Concrete (IfcSlab, IfcWall) is rough and matte. Glass (IfcWindow, IfcCurtainWall) is near-mirror.
- **Cinematic tone mapping**: ACESFilmic with tuned exposure. No washed-out greys.
- **Procedural environment map**: vertex-coloured gradient sky via PMREMGenerator — subtle reflections on all PBR materials without HDR textures.
- **Batched X-ray**: material `needsUpdate` spread across 3 frames (45 materials per frame) — eliminates GPU shader recompile stutter on toggle.

### Visibility Culling (DLOD)

Two-tier frustum culling, both pure visibility — no geometry simplified or replaced:

- **BatchedMesh** (unique elements): Three.js r184 `perObjectFrustumCulled` handles per-slot culling natively inside `renderer.render()` — zero JS cost. 84% of slots hidden when camera is inside a room.
- **InstancedMesh** (repeated elements, desktop only): Custom zero-scale matrix trick hides off-screen instances. ~32% hidden at typical zoom. ~1.5ms tick for 35K instances.

Mobile skips the custom DLOD tick entirely — r184 native culling handles BatchedMesh, and InstancedMesh buffer re-upload (`instanceMatrix.needsUpdate`) costs more than it saves on mobile GPUs. Instead: on-demand render gate (skip `renderer.render()` when idle) + DPR 0.75 during orbit (44% fewer pixels while dragging) + render throttle (1/10 frames during streaming) + 20K bbox cap (sampled for buildings >20K elements).

What you see is exactly what is in the IFC file — no proxies, no LOD geometry, no simplification.

**WebGPU status (S276b):** The viewer is WebGPU-ready — `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` detects hardware WebGPU and activates `WebGPURenderer` automatically. Currently all browsers fall back to WebGL r184 (Intel iGPU = no adapter, mobile = skipped for stability, Chrome Linux PRIME = SwiftShader rejected). WebGL r184 performs better than r160 even without WebGPU — the upgrade delivers improved batching, native frustum culling, and cleaner shader compilation. WebGPU will activate automatically when browser/GPU support matures.

### City-Scale Streaming — 1,000,000+ elements (S285)

The same viewer scales from one building to an entire city: **1,035,522 elements across 52 buildings (24 archetypes)** in one browser tab, with no server and the same 500KB of code. Five techniques make a million elements tractable on a desktop browser:

- **Facade-first residency.** A city is mostly hidden services — across the city, MEP/plumbing/structure is ~86% of elements; the architectural facade (ARC) is only ~14% (145K elements). The city streams **ARC only** by default, so the whole facade builds and stays resident. Structure and MEP for a building load on demand when you go into it. From the street you never see a building's pipes, so they are never fetched or built.
- **Element-count memory budget.** Residency is bounded by **element count (~250K, the measured browser-pressure knee)**, not bytes — the honest limit for geometry the browser can hold. The whole ARC facade (145K) sits comfortably under it and is never evicted while panning the overview.
- **Visibility streaming by ray-blast.** A 6×4 grid of rays from the camera is tested against one axis-aligned bounding box per building (≈52 boxes, sub-millisecond) — first-hit per ray gives free occlusion: a building behind another is never streamed. The set of streamed buildings follows the camera.
- **Distance/visibility eviction with hysteresis.** Buildings that leave the view are demoted back to their bounding-box placeholder and their geometry freed — farthest and largest first, never the small spread-out buildings (kept as cheap context), and only after being out of view for two consecutive frames (no pop-off/pop-back churn). A ghost sweep frees any straggler mesh whose building was evicted mid-stream.
- **Incremental BVH.** Bounding-volume hierarchies are built only for newly-added geometry in a single background pass — never a re-walk of the whole geometry cache — so a heavy building no longer stalls the tab.

The launch sprouts small buildings first (they render fast and are visibly spread out), then fills in the large ones. Entering a building (it fills ~70% of the view) frees the distant facades and meshes that one building in full.

## Performance

Measured on a standard laptop (Intel i7, integrated GPU, Chrome):

| Building | Elements | Geometry DB | Cache Load | Draw Calls | Orbit FPS |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| SampleHouse | 218 | 0.4 MB | instant | 45 | 60 |
| FZKHaus | 620 | 1.2 MB | instant | 89 | 60 |
| Clinic (federated MEP) | 16,114 | 72 MB | <1s | ~1,800 | 60 |
| Terminal | 48,428 | 249 MB | <1s | ~2,000 | 45-60 |
| Hospital | 63,182 | 318 MB | <1s | ~3,500 | 30-45 |
| LTU A-House | 122,330 | 379 MB | <1s | ~15,000 | 20-30 |

All measurements with geometry cached in IndexedDB. First load depends on network speed for the initial database download.

## Spatial ERP — Browser-Based ERP Engine

BIM OOTB includes an ERP engine using iDempiere's Application Dictionary
(AD) rendered in a browser via SQLite WASM. Full specification: `docs/ERP.md`.

### Architecture

Three-layer separation (ERP.md §11):
- **Data:** 5 core tables (containers, items, documents, document_lines,
  journal) + kernel_ops event log. Legacy iDempiere tables (C_BPartner,
  M_Product, etc.) coexist in the same SQLite database for imported
  reference data.
- **Logic:** Business rules as pure JavaScript functions (`rules/*.js`).
  Each takes a db handle + document ID, reads via SQL, writes via
  `commitOp()`. Independently testable.
- **Presentation:** Constellation globe (initbubble.json, <300ms first
  paint), cascading accordion drill, compiled manifest for field
  definitions.

AD metadata (13MB, 1,003 table definitions, 59K rows) is treated as
compile-time input. A build script extracts the needed window/tab/field
definitions into a ~2KB manifest.json. The browser loads the manifest,
not the full AD. See ERP.md §13.

### Database Coverage

ad_seed.db contains 356 of iDempiere's 1,003 tables (35%). Missing
tables are server-only infrastructure (~400: processors, auth, alerts,
import staging, views, translations) and advanced business modules
(~250: manufacturing, commissions, dunning, subscriptions, quality
control). All GardenWorld business data and all AD metadata are present.
See ERP.md §16.1.

Storage: PostgreSQL GardenWorld ~350MB; SQLite equivalent 12.1MB (29x
compression). 151 bytes/row vs 500-800 in PostgreSQL. Difference is
MVCC, WAL, TOAST, and system catalog overhead — required for multi-user
servers, unnecessary in single-user browser. See ERP.md §16.2.

### Construction ERP vs Primavera / Procore

| Capability | BIM OOTB | Primavera P6 | Procore | SAP PS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4D Schedule + 3D Model | Same browser tab | Separate tools | Separate | Separate |
| 5D Cost + BOQ | Extracted from IFC | Manual input | Manual | Manual |
| Offline | Yes | No | No | No |
| Server required | No | Oracle DB | Cloud | SAP HANA |
| Licence cost | Free (MIT) | $3-8K/user/yr | $375+/mo | Enterprise |
| IFC integration | Native | None | Limited | None |
| BOM from model | Automatic | N/A | N/A | Manual |
| Install | URL | Desktop | Cloud | On-premise/cloud |
| ERP foundation | iDempiere AD (open) | Proprietary | Proprietary | Proprietary |

### iDempiere Relationship

ERP OOTB uses iDempiere's AD as the source for UI metadata. The
compiled manifest preserves the AD's tab hierarchy, field ordering,
FK relationships, and mandatory flags in a 2KB JSON file. Legacy
tables from the PostgreSQL export coexist with the 5-table runtime
model. When a user needs a feature served by a table not yet loaded
(e.g., C_Commission), the manifest defines its structure and data is
fetched on demand. See ERP.md §16.6.

### Key Differences

**vs Autodesk APS**: Autodesk requires a cloud pipeline — IFC uploads to their server, converts to a proprietary format (SVF2), and streams pre-processed tiles back. This takes minutes per model, costs per API call, and cannot function offline. BIM OOTB processes IFC once into SQLite and runs entirely from local cache thereafter.

**vs IFC.js / ThatOpen Company**: IFC.js parses IFC files in the browser using a WASM module at load time. This works for small models but becomes slow above 20K elements because it re-parses geometry on every page load. BIM OOTB pre-extracts geometry into a SQLite database with content-hash deduplication, so repeat visits load from cache without re-parsing.

**vs Desktop viewers (Solibri, BIMvision, Navisworks)**: Desktop applications require installation, licensing, and specific operating systems. BIM OOTB runs on any device with a browser — including tablets on a construction site with no internet after the initial cache.

## IFC Geometry: What Authoring Tools Actually Export

A common objection to mesh-based BIM viewers is that triangle meshes lose the mathematical precision of B-rep (boundary representation) solids — NURBS surfaces, exact booleans, parametric history. This is technically true but misidentifies where the loss occurs.

### The IFC Tessellation Chain

Authoring tools (Revit, ArchiCAD, Tekla) maintain B-rep internally for interactive editing. But when they export to IFC, they tessellate:

| IFC Representation | What It Is | Who Exports It |
|---|---|---|
| `IfcFacetedBrep` | Planar polygonal faces (triangle soup) | Revit, ArchiCAD, most exporters |
| `IfcTriangulatedFaceSet` | Explicit triangle mesh (IFC4) | Revit (IFC4 mode), Tekla |
| `IfcExtrudedAreaSolid` | Linear extrusion of a 2D profile | All (simple walls, columns) |
| `IfcSweptSolid` | Profile swept along a path | ArchiCAD, Tekla |
| `IfcAdvancedBrep` | NURBS surfaces (true B-rep) | Virtually no production exporter |

A dome that is a parametric `Revolution` family inside Revit's `.rvt` arrives in the IFC as `IfcFacetedBrep` — thousands of flat triangles. The B-rep was discarded by the authoring tool's own exporter, not by the viewer.

### Downstream Industry Practice

No commercial BIM workflow downstream of authoring operates on B-rep:

- **Navisworks** (Autodesk's own clash detection) — tessellated meshes internally
- **Solibri** (model checking) — tessellated meshes
- **Robot / ETABS** (structural analysis) — simplified stick/shell models, not NURBS
- **CostX / Procore** (cost estimation) — quantities from schedules + faceted visual reference
- **Primavera P6** (4D scheduling) — no geometry at all
- **Trimble FieldLink** (site layout) — survey points and coordinates

If Autodesk's own billion-dollar coordination product (Navisworks) runs clash detection on tessellated meshes, the precision is sufficient for construction delivery.

### Where B-rep Matters (and Where It Doesn't)

B-rep kernels (OpenCascade, Parasolid) are essential for **design authoring** — push/pull faces, fillet edges, compute precise booleans. That is Revit's job.

Construction-phase BIM — viewing, measuring, clash detection, 4D scheduling, 5D costing, field coordination — operates on the **IFC deliverable**, which is already tessellated at source. Sub-millimeter measurement accuracy is a coordinate precision problem (Float64), not a surface representation problem.

BIM OOTB consumes the IFC file as-is. What the architect exported is what the site team sees. No re-modelling, no re-tessellation, no geometry invented beyond what the authoring tool provided.
